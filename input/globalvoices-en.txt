Africa Cup of Nations: David knows kung fu and he’s Googled you! · Global Voices
The 2010 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon 2010) is currently taking place in Angola. The tournament began on 10 January 2010 and will conclude on 31 January.
SuperSport, the provider of pay-television sports coverage across the continent of Africa, has a team of sports bloggers discussing Afcon 2010.
Here is a short roundup of posts from SuperSport Afcon 2010 Blogs:
David knows kung fu and he's Googled you!, begins a post by Thomas Mlambo's post about Afcon 2010 suprises:
David knows kung fu and he’s Googled you!
Well, well, well, talk about an Afcon of surprises.
For many years now, in football anywhere in the world, the traditional superpowers, or so-called Goliaths, have dominated and pretty much bullied the minnows, or as I will refer to them, the Davids of the game, except in the odd friendly match.
But in keeping with the way the world is now, “David” has recently purchased himself a gym contract, consults a personal trainer , does yoga every morning and rides his mountain bike on weekends, all while going to martial arts class every Tuesday, just as a way of keeping fit.
David is now fit, focused and prepared. He’s not a scared boy with a rock in his hand anymore.
The end result?
A nation like Malawi has won a first ever Africa cup of Nations finals match, destroying Fifa 2010 World Cup qualifier Algeria 3-0 on the second day of the tournament.
Burkina Faso then had me watching a game in Cabinda against Cote d’Ivoire where it was clear that their coach, Paulo Duarte (known as the Mourinho of Africa, as he was once “the special one's “ assistant ), had used the Internet to study the superstars they would face and had found a website called “KeepDrogbaQuiet.com”.
"Have playing standards plummeted at the Afcon?," asks Mark Ouma, a football analyst on Soccer Africa on SS3:
When Hassan Shetata says the competition standard at the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations has dropped, it triggers an increased desire to take a closer look at proceedings in Angola.
Ever since taking charge of the Egyptian Pharaohs, coach Shehata has been a man of very few words. So something special must have triggered his comment. Three inter.pretations come to mind.
First, at face value, there is a measure of merit in Shehata’s words.
The African teams in Angola who will be going to the World Cup in June — Algeria, Cameroon, Ghana, Nigeria, and Cote d’Ivoire — failed to win their opening matches in Angola.
It could be argued that each showed the lack of commitment that drove them to prevail in Africa’s most rigorous World Cup qualifying contest.
Subsequently the five teams won their second match. Now they are all through to the quarterfinal.
Going forward there are valid lessons for each of the World Cup-bound teams. The level of competition at the World Cup will be far more stringent.
Thomas Mlambo believes that "goalkeepers really can give you an upset stomach":
I wasn’t going to write a new blog for a few days still but it’s the only thing I can do to try relieve the foul mood that watching Zambia lose to Cameroon put me in.
I’d just had a great dinner during the break between matches and had eased into my favourite position on my most comfortable chair so that I could fully concentrate on a match that would see the fluid, stylish Chipolopolo try upset the rather poor, and so far relatively toothless, lions
Then I was given indigestion…
Goalkeepers really can give you an upset stomach, Kennedy Mweene‘s (one month) late Christmas gift to the Cameroonians, spoilt my evening.
I mean, I’m not Zambian, but still the sight of that “granny power” hopeful of a shot from Geremi actually crossing the line to bring the Lions level literally gave me heartburn.
It had me reaching for my phone to call both Ponga (Liwewe) and Mamadou (Gaye) just so that I could vent my frustration.
Damnit, it’s not easy to watch football home alone; there’s nobody there to swear at when such upsetting things happen.
Mamadou Gaye, one of the most popular and controversial sports commentator in Africa, did not believe that the Super Eagles will get far in the tournament:
It’s bye bye Super Eagles Bonjour a tous, I would like to start by presenting my sincere apologies to my dear friend, the Big Boss Keshi, and all of you.
Keshi is a good friend of mine, I could not control myself to see him failing, but I had no intention to undermine his qualities or character.
During his tenure as the Malian national coach I visited him at least seven times to give him my support. Once again, I say sorry to all of you that got hurt. I promise you that I will never repeat it again.
I feel very honored and humbled by the messages you keep sending to me. I appreciate your understanding and passion for our common game of football.
At last the group stage of the 27th edition of the Africa Cup of Nations is over. With it come tears of joy and sadness.
My predictions had mixed results.
For now the Super Eagles can say bye bye Angola 2010, after managing to beat the two greatest underachievers of the Nations Cup: Benin and Mozambique, who never won a single game in their history of the Africa Cup of Nations.
You might be asking yourself, why I am insisting on retiring some players?
We know as a fact that in our continent most players cheated in their age.
When Angola, the host nation, was eliminated by Ghana, Lubango was so quiet even dogs did not bark that night, reports Thomas Kwenaite from Lubango, Angola:
Lubango went to sleep early on Sunday night.
The hosts of the 27th edition of the Africa Cup of Nations — Angola — have been eliminated by Ghana, who defeated them 1-0 in the quarterfinals.
There were no motorbikes that skidded and screeched their tyres across the tarmac or the blaring of car hooters.
I couldn’t even hear a dog bark!
Thomas also writes about his experience traveling in Angola:
We arrived in Lubango in the most dramatic fashion.
Again, I must confess that I do not harbour a negative attitude towards Angola but really, to undertake a journey of 35 minutes in 10 hours and five minutes is unacceptable, with no one bothering to inform us that the plane had been delayed.
In fact, since our arrival in Angola three weeks ago, every time we undertook a trip to the provinces of Cabinda, Benguela and Lubango, we arrived at the airport as early as 7am but would reach our destination any time after 6pm and sadly, much as my Angolan friends try to make it sound as if I whine a lot, that is unacceptable. Their airline needs to jack up its act.
I am not trying to be funny but for a domestic flight to be delayed by seven hours without anyone from officialdom attempting to notify you as to what went wrong is shocking.
I accepted the first day, when it took us eight hours for a 40-minute flight, that perhaps the volume of people in the country is a new experience to them and makes it impossible for them to ferry their passengers around on time.
Nigeria has secured a spot in the semi-finals after beating Zambia's Chipolopolo boys.
But does Charles Anazodo still believe that the god of football is Nigerian?
Sweden: Parliament Recognizes the Assyrian Genocide · Global Voices
With a vote of 131 against 130, the Swedish Parliament recognized as genocide the massacres that took place within the Ottoman Empire from 1913 to 1920 against the Armenian, Assyrian and Pontic Greek population - an episode that is also referred to as "Seyfo" by the Assyrian Diaspora.
Up to 1.5 million Armenians, 250,000 Pontic Greeks and 250,000 Assyrians were killed between 1913 and 1920, and a few other millions had to flee from what is now Turkey, in order to survive.
Other sources claim the real number of Assyrians and Pontic Greeks murdered reach up to 750,000 and 500,000 respectively.
Phillip Ohlund, in the New Testament News blog, comments saying:
The fact is all those who voted against the motion did not claim nor say that the genocide did not happen. All of them were saying yes the genocide took place, however a majority of them said we need to be loyal to the Coalition Government's decision and others were fearing a yes vote would jeopardize the relations with Turkey. Volkan Kemal, in the Adsiz Vesaire blog, tells us that the result caused distress over the Turkish government and even among some Swedish ministers:
The Turkish Ambassador to Sweden was immediately ordered to leave the country and Turkish prime minister Erdogan announced the cancellation of his planned visit to Sweden the coming week. Sweden's pro-Turkish foreign minister, Carl Bildt was very upset by the decision of the parliament and warned it will harm Swedish-Turkish relations and Turkish-Armenian relations as the resolution called for the recognition of not only the Turkish genocide on Assyrians but also the genocides on Armenians and Pontic Greeks. However, Sweden's foreign minister Carl Bildt disagrees with the resolution.
The Assyrian Genocide is officially recognized by my new favorite country, Sweden. Sweden is the first country to accept the Genocide of the Assyrians, but also has accepted the Genocide of the Pontic-Greeks and Armenians perpetrated by the Ottoman Turks. This is a great day for Assyrians.
Not only will the souls of those that were wrongly and innocently butchered like cattle be rested, the world will be enlightened of the first genocide of the 20th Century. This recognition comes shortly after the one passed by the US congressional Foreign Affairs Committee, as a non-biding resolution which acknowledges the 1915 mass killings as the "Armenian Genocide" with the votes of 23 against 22.

Ada Lovelace Day: Celebrating Women in Technology and Transparency Worldwide · Global Voices
Inspired by Ellen Miller's post on the Sunlight Foundation blog, which profiles the work of women who use technology to promote transparency in the United States, we decided to add to the list by profiling several women from around the world involved in the use of technology to make government more transparent and accountable.
The following profiles were written and researched by Renata Avila, the lead of Creative Commons Guatemala, the Director of Primer Palabra, and our researcher for Spanish-language Latin America on the Technology for Transparency Network.
In Mexico, Irma Eréndida Sandoval heads up a laboratory to document corruption and research the best transparency policies. “Laboratorio de Documentación y Análisis de la Corrupción y la Transparencia” at UNAM, the Autonomous National Mexican University, is one of the most prestigious institutions in Latin America.
In Iceland, parliamentarian Birgitta Jónsdóttir is promoting the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative, a proposal to create a global safe haven for investigative journalism in Iceland that would improve freedom of expression and transparency worldwide by protecting watchdog groups and whistleblowers from libel censorship.
It is important not only approve good laws to promote transparency and openness but also protect a free country from becoming less transparent.
An activist from Germany, Franziska Heine, initiated the most successful e-petition in German history, aimed to prevent a law which would give the German police the right to create and maintain censorship lists with websites to be blocked by German ISPs.
It was signed more than 134,000 times.
Franziska is part of the anti-censorship movement and is engaged in several activities and organizations which fight against surveillance, data mining, censorship and other threats to civil rights.
But good laws and proactive citizens are not enough; tools are also important to enable women around the world to take action and promote transparency.
Margarita Padilla, an IT engineer and the former director of the magazine Mundo Linux is making a difference.
She creates and maintains systems with a social approach and also promotes openness with her website Sin Dominio.
Mercedes de Freitas from Venezuela is the Executive Director of Transparencia Venezuela, the local chapter of Transparency International and is former Ashoka Changemaker Fellow for her work in promoting civic participation to increase government accountability.
These are surely just a few examples of women around the world who are using technology to challenge corruption, improve the performance of institutions, and create better policy to engage citizens and hold public officials accountable.
As a recent article by Alexandra Starr notes, both the fields of technology and government have long excluded women from participation despite their impressive track record for approaching both policy and technology with more realism and tact than their male counterparts.
Software companies and parliamentary buildings around the world are still mostly dominated by men, but this is changing quickly thanks to a new generation of women technologists, activists, and politicians.
I would be remiss to not highlight the work of our female researchers and research reviewers who, it must be said, have proven themselves to be the hardest working members of our team on the Technology for Transparency Network.
Renata Avila, who wrote the profiles of all of the women above, is a lawyer, human rights activist, the country lead of Creative Commons Guatemala, and the director of Primer Palabra.
She has worked with the Rigoberta Menchu Tum Foundation, Harvard University, the Public Voice, and Women in International Security.

Is Russia an Enemy of Internet? · Global Voices
The degree of freedom on the Russian Internet is an issue for debates.
Some put Russia on the same list of "Internet enemies" with China and Iran.
Others strongly oppose this kind of generalization and claim that Russian Internet is the most liberal and unrestricted public sphere in the country.
The recent “Internet enemies” report by international non-governmental organization “Reporters Without Borders” tried to bring some order in regards to placement of Russia on the Internet freedom scale.
The organization placed the country on the list of “Countries under surveillance.”
This placement and especially the justification for it by the report’s authors raised discussion and disagreement in Russia.
The original report states :
After the takeover by the Kremlin of the audiovisual media early in the Putin era, the Internet became the freest space for discussion and information-sharing in Russia.
Yet its dependence is threatened by blogger arrests and prosecutions, and the blocking of independent websites labeled as “extremist.”
The Web has also become a first-rate sphere of activity for government propaganda and could become a political control mechanism.
It names a long list of government affiliated activities that should be considered as limitation of Internet freedom.
Among those activities is web surveillance system “SORM-2″ that makes possible to monitor online content for security agencies.
The reported also noted the fact that some of major social media platforms were bought out by oligarchs with close ties to the government.
"Reporters Without Borders" additionally cited the story of blocking oppositional websites by WIMAX Internet provider Yota, cyber attacks against liberal websites and persecutions against bloggers.
But there are some more optimistic statements.
The report suggests that “the Internet has become a space in which people can denounce the corruption of Russian officials.”
However, it concludes that despite this fact “the impact of these online mobilizations, blogs and new media on Russian society is still relatively limited” and warns that censorship on RuNet (Russian Internet) may increase.
Right after the report was released, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a broadcaster funded by the U.S. Congress, asked few Russian Internet experts to comment on the report.
Famous blogger and journalist Oleg Kozyrev said to RFE/RL:
Philippines: Internet cafe hard disks registration · Global Voices
The Philippine Optical Media Board (OMB) recently proposed to require internet cafe operators to register the hard disks in their computers.
According to the OMB, the presence of magnetic components in hard disks makes them fall under the control of the OMB based on the Optical Media Act of 2003.
An association of Filipino internet cafe owners have raised their opposition to the hard disk registration proposal saying that this "will bring the ICT industry as a whole back to the Ice Age."
JC John Sese Cuneta, commenting on Azrael's Maryland's blog opinion that the proposal is stupid, raised the need for technology-literate politicians in the national elections: hows us the need to know who of the candidates are tech and net-aware, so we can vote for them.
Japan: A whale of a controversy · Global Voices
Only a few days after “The Cove” was awarded the Oscar as best documentary drawing the attention of public and media around the world to the hunting of cetaceans issue, anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd’s leader Peter Bethune was arrested in Tokyo , re-igniting the controversy between Japan and Australia - New Zealand.
The protest group activist is charged with trespassing, for boarding a Japanese whaling ship in the Southern ocean during February while attempting to make a citizen’s arrest of its captain for the sinking of the Sea Shepherd’s ship one month earlier (as previously reported for Global Voices by Kevin Rennie).
Ady Gil. By Flickr id: james975. Although Japan’s whaling program is only authorised for scientific purposes and most of the Japanese people do not regard whale meat their favourite meal, the collision with the New Zealand anti-whaling vessel has roused some sentiment of nationalism , though weak, in the country.
But ‘jingoistic’ sentiments are also evident in the announcement of Peter Bethune’s arrest on the Sea Shepherd official website.
The Japanese whaling ship Shonan Maru 2 arrived in Tokyo today with the first New Zealand prisoner of war to be transported to Japan as a political prisoner since World War II.As soon as his foot touched Japanese soil, Captain Bethune reestablished himself as a national hero in New Zealand and an international hero in Australia, France, Britain, the United States, and every other country whose citizens deplore the continued illegal whaling activities of the Japanese whaling fleet.
In Japan, some feel New Zealand and Australia’s anti-whaling activity as an attack on their country’s food culture and wonder why whale meat should be prohibited while cattle and pig meat is not.
It highlights the contentious divide between slaughtering debatably intelligent versus non intelligent animals.
In some cases Japanese media increasingly rode the wave of polemic on the issue.
James at Japan Probe posts about Japanese broadcaster NTV’s show ‘Bankisha’ reporting on the Sea Shepherd issue.
In the first part of the show he says, attention is paid to analyzing Sea Shepherd’s funding sources and budget.
The second half of the clip is about Sea Shepherd’s next target: the bluefin tuna fishing in the Mediterranean.
It looks like many countries have teamed up to ban the fishing of the species, and since 80% of the catch is sold on the Japanese market, it is being interpreted as yet another attack on Japan’s cultural traditions.
Joining the reporters in the studio are an art director who does marketing for many of Japan’s famous brands and a legal scholar.
The legal scholar points out how America used to kill whales for oil.
He also thinks the American position towards Japanese whaling is influenced by an underlying hostility that the “white world” feels towards Japanese.
The art director thinks that Japan needs to do a better job at presenting its case to the world, as so many people in other countries don’t understand why Japanese people eat whale meat. 2008-12-26 SS encounters Japanese whaling ship.
There is no reason that whales should be treated any differently to any other resource. Whales should be managed properly, so they aren’t recklessly driven extinct, but there’s no good moral reason to privilege the “rights” of whales over the right of humans to hunt them.
Poland: R.I.P. Black Saturday 10.04.2010 · Global Voices
Candles in Warsaw, photo by Maria Seidel
As we live through the first 24 hours of the tragedy of the Polish nation, social media present various reactions to this morning's events, when Poland lost its President and 95 other important personalities.
On Facebook, people are gathering in newly established groups:
for Poles who died today near Smoleńsk.
We unite in tragedy R.I.P. Black Saturday 10.04.2010
Some still struggle with accepting the facts:
Others stress the importance of remembering today's catastrophe and the place where it happened:
Many point out the sad irony of the entire accident:
They flew to pay tribute to the victims of Katyń and became victims themselves...

Social networking site 'Nasza-Klasa' also hosts a significant amount of posts expressing condolences to families, sadness for the nation and a new vision of unity around the person of the President for the entire country:
When he lived some supported him, others opposed him.
The tragedy caused everyone to back him up!
It's sad that only now he was chosen for the President, while we used to joke about him during his life... now it's only sadness and grief because Our President is gone and many others too.
It's sad and depressing that only now he is appreciated (*) Feeling strongly for their families and those who really regret it all !!!!
A scout girl in Warsaw, photo by Maria Seidel
While waiting for official statements, on forums and in comments to news articles, people start discussing the actual reasons behind the accident.
Roled lists the most obvious ones: 1.
You fly old trash, which even pilots fear to manage.
You fly old trash in difficult weather conditions, without seeing a thing.
You decide to land this trash in an airport which is unsuitable for difficult conditions.
On board you have 80+ people, mainly the important ones.
It is common knowledge that a certain person already has a history of forcing pilots to be "less scared"
The results, if one can think clearly, are for them to see.
Wujek_extrema speculates :
Sadly, I do believe in the pressure put on pilots.
I can almost hear one of them say: "We will not let the Russians dictate what we should do" - especially on the way to Katyń.
It will be an international shame on us, once it becomes official.
nych refers to the possibility of the President's intervention : If the Russians advised them not to land, I am sure Kaczor personally decided otherwise, he could not run late for the mess.
xyz points out the potential reasons behind decisions of this kind : There were experienced pilots and generals on board.
They must have been conscious of landing risks of that type of machine in those conditions.
It could have been the case of some people taking the advice of changing airport as planned delay/making it impossible to take part in celebrations and maybe they were too ambitious - we will never know the truth.
pfg questions the irresponsibility of having so many officials travel on the same plane :
I do understand that the President flew with MP's, his ministers, general Gągor and other officials. But all major army heads in one plane - it is unbelievable.
While we are still waiting for answers to those questions, Wykop users focus on the fact that the world is learning the truth about the Katyń massacre itself.
Hemus writes : @JamesikR Despite the tragedy of the whole situation, you are right.
Even though I have mixed feelings, I think that maybe today's tragedy will open the eyes of the West and we will not hear in future statements about the "Polish concentration camps."
Death of those dozens of people will not shade the death of thousands.
Mczarny follows up on the comments of users who claim that high traffic on main search engines is due to simple curiosity about the accident: Thank God for human curiosity.
I will go further to state that today's tragedy will not go wasted and will show what others were fighting for - the memory.
Sadly, they paid the highest price.
Zexon comments on a positive note, mentioning that is can also lead to better relationships between Poland and Russia:
And maybe there'll be an improvement in the Polish-Russian relationships.
All flags at half mast, photo by Maria Seidel
Blogging engine blox.pl, in response to increasing amount of blog reactions, has asked readers to collate their posts in the comments section.
Bloggers, like Grzegorz Ajdukiewicz, share their stories of the day, including photos: This tragical event totally ruined my day.
I started going to an event in the series called Photo Day (already edition #8.0).
In the area of closed for refurbishment Central Station dozens of reporters gathered.
One of them marched next to me talking on the phone.
I heard "President," "all died?" etc.
I thought it was a joke (saying something in the crowd to start a gossip).
I walked out of the stinky underground passage and walked into the almost closed down bar, where to my surprise they still had a TV LCD.
It was on, a few people stared at it with open mouths.
It was 9:56 AM.
Everything became apparent.
It was not a joke!
Sadly!
Others, like yesss, keep their posts very short : Pity for the people, it is people I am sad for. Not looking at colors and opinions.
Deeply sad.
Bronisław Komorowski, who stepped in to lead the country until the next election, reassured the Poles in their feelings of this day in his official speech : Today in the light of our national drama we are united.
Today there is no left, no right wing.
Division of opinions and beliefs is of no importance.
Today we are united, standing in the front of the enormous drama, in the eye of the death of many people.
We join in the pain of families of the victims and in the worry of our Motherland bereaved by them.
A special thanks to Maria Seidel for providing photos from Warsaw.
South Africa: The woman who spent 7 months in a male cell · Global Voices
Before she was acquitted of attempted robbery and hijacking in South Africa, Denise Abbah was imprisoned in a male cell for seven months as she waited for her trial.
The prison officials mistook her for a transvestite.
Ms Abbah is now seeking justice as she is suing the Department of Correctional Services for damages amounting to R100 000.
According to IOL six years after her release Denise Abbah is ready for a fight with the department on the ordeal she went through.

Uganda: On the screening of gay porn in church · Global Voices
Has Pastor Martin Ssempa gone too far?
Over 300 people were gathered in church last week by the controversial anti- gay bill supporter Pastor Ssempa to watch gay porn for back up support for the anti- gay bill.
His strong attempts to make the bill relevant even after it is clear that the President Museveni has trashed it and his publicized "million man march" was supposed to come to a halt as it was obstructed for "security concerns".
The church was packed as many people came to see what homosexuals really do in their bedrooms, pastor Ssempa then went on to show graphic images of men in situations.
An interactive Kenyan site capitalfm.co.ke discusses the issue:
KAMPALA, Uganda, Feb 17 - A pastor seeking to bolster Uganda's anti-gay laws which already make homosexuality punishable by life imprisonment screened gay porn in a packed Kampala church Wednesday in a bid to drum up support.
The screening was attended by around 300 supporters crammed into an evangelical church in the Ugandan capital after plans for a "million-man march" were thwarted by police: "We had planned to have a million-man and -woman march in Kampala but unfortunately we were told that we could not march because of security concerns," Martin Ssempa told the crowd.
Police in the Ugandan capital Kampala blocked the demonstration that was due on the same day and he moved the rally to Jinja:
On Sunday, Police moved to halt a planned demonstration in support of the controversial Anti-Homosexuality Bill saying that the government is still sorting ‘issues out’ as pro-gay activists under the Unitarian Universalist Church of Kampala secretly met to condemn the same bill. … Gen. Kayihura confirmed that he hasn’t cleared the demonstration and said, “We asked them to postpone the demonstration because government has some issues to sort out and they agreed,”.
Homosexuals in Uganda are still vulnerable to his attacks as he continues to advocate the killing of gays and life imprisonment.
His support for the bill is so overwhelming by a show of his organized march and screening of gay porn in church to expose gays to more hate; the legislation to demonize homosexuals is so strong as more people embrace his articulate and charismatic power to influence.
Changing attitude highlights from GUG blog on how people applaud to his sermons on how the bible says gays should be killed:
In his report about Ssempa’s gay pornography Ash Wednesday in church, gug says he has heard that some mainstream Christians have had enough and are going to publicly oppose the bill.
They are Anglicans and their strongly heart-felt opposition will be in marked contrast to the 'wishy washy hypocrisy' of the Church of Uganda.
If they are to have any more credibility, says gug, Christians will have to claim back their Church.
Gug watched the programme Agenda Uganda on NTV last night, in which Pastor Solomon Male justified the killing of gay Ugandans because they have refused to change.
He said gays should be killed because the Bible says so, and the audience applauded – another extraordinary message for Ash Wednesday.
The debate continues on how culture rewards people who advocate the killing of gays and the pastor airing his sentiments and how he has gone to far.
Below are some of the comments left on Capital FM by readers:
Haiya.This whole issue can be looked at in two perspectives,one-A church as a group of people have the right to give out their views as far as homosexuality and lesbianism is concerned.This is because one of the purpose of the church is to mold and produce upright people of the nation.
Since police deny them an opportunity to match and air their views in open places, there was no other way of informing the poor/innocent citizens of the facts of homosexuality life,other than to enter into there places of work and teach them there followers.
On the other side,the pornographic films are not supposed to be shown inside the God's temple.It could have been maybe at Mandela stadium where,though not sure,any group can demonstrate.
Therefore let us not only see that part of showing porn at church but how will the common man in the village know what is good and /or bad of homo/heterosexuality?
Lets not deny pastors of talking about the issue.
This is one of the results of being a mediocre church.
The devil is very tactical so he knows how to do 'infotainment' even on the pulpit.
Satan has used Martin Ssempe to entertain people who came to praise their creator, He has also used the pastor to educate people on bedroom gay instead of teaching God's word.
Jesus is coming sooner than we think.
That Kampala church is not a congregation but a crowd of onlookers and idlers.
No wonder the reporter calls them crowd.
How can they sit and watch,instead of ousting the pastor?
It is very worrying at this moment in Uganda to see a "man of God" i hear "Dr,Pastor Martin Ssempa" doing a disgrace to the Christians of Uganda and East Africa as a block.
In Uganda to start with promoting pornography is illegal, Un christian/un Godly if its done in church, To worsen matters its un cultural/ un African to talk about sex in public irrespective of being homosexual or heterosexual porn.
This makes me wonder, Do we really have law enforcement people in Uganda? or the Right wing Christians are becoming untouchable simply because the state house is full of right wing Christians starting with the Big man to the gardener?
Having met one on one with the LGBTI activists in Uganda several times, i have come to believe and respect them for the work they are doing, simply because one has to step on them for them to wake up and say we are being stepped on.
These people do not condone Defilement and pedophilia irrespective of sexuality.
So that leaves me wondering How is it the church's business for what 2 consenting adults do in the privacy of their bedroom?
Is the church out of work or its clergy men are just too obsessed with sex and how people have it?
Fellow Christians, lets get our facts right about the responsibilities of the church and the state. lets not mix the two otherwise we shall find ourselves having canon laws or Quranic laws governing us.
I am not saying they are bad, but they don't fit anymore because they are not fair to the non believers.

China: New real estate policy hits market · Global Voices
New housing policy issued by the State Council April 17 has received an unprecedented reaction from the public, Southern Weekend reports.
Analysts and economists have called the policy “the strictest in history.”
Construction in Guangzhou, Guangdong (photo/ Don Weinland) The State Council has requested an increase in down payments on loans for second homes.
Buyers looking to purchase a second home less than 90 square meters must make no less than a 50 percent down payment.
The ratio for properties over 90 square meters is set at no less than 30 percent.
Loans for the purchase of third homes have been temporarily stopped, as have loans to buyers from outside regions who cannot prove a year of local tax or social insurance payment.
This is the first policy to regulate the purchasing of third homes, Southern Weekend reports.
The measures come as an attempt to regulate and suppress the real estate speculation that many believe has distorted healthy market signals and driven prices sky-high.
Since 2003 a wide range of policies have accompanied, guided, and misguided the great fluctuation of the of the Chinese real estate market.
Blogger Zhu Daming writes that flaws in this April’s policy change should be evident from past policy blunders.
He suggests regulation of loans for second homes will ultimately lead to the continued inflation of the market.

Brazil: Creating Opportunities for Life After Jail · Global Voices
In the 1990s Ronaldo Monteiro was convicted for extortion by kidnapping and sentenced to 28 years in prison in Brazil.
While serving his time, Monteiro and some fellow inmates were concerned for the wellbeing of their families in their absence.
They responded to the situation by setting up a workshop inside the jail where they recycled and sold paper.
A portion of the profit went towards improving their equipment, and the rest was shared among their families.
That's how project Uma Chance (A Chance) started.
The Center for Digital Inclusion (CDI) began offering short courses on information technology to detainees.
Monteiro enrolled and learned fast; he was soon invited to teach as well.
The project expanded to other penitentiaries, and family members were also invited to participate.
In this documentary by Mixer Productions, Monteiro explains how he pursued a new path from inside jail and turned his life around (subtitles in English): ( )
Event to celebrate the third year of ‘Growing up with Citizenship' at CISC.
Photo by Danny Silva, used with permission. In 2002, while still incarcerated, Monteiro created the Center of Social and Cultural Integration known as CISC-Uma Chance, which offers courses on IT and recycling to communities of Tribobó, in São Gonçalo, in Greater Rio de Janeiro.
They work to make opportunities available to more people, as CISC develops activities in cooking, citizen awareness, healthy lifestyle and preparation for university.
In 2003, Monteiro was granted parole.
New beginnings
In 2006, Monteiro went one step further and created the impressive Incubadora de Empreendimentos para Egressos (IEE) (Incubator of Small Businesses for Ex-Detainees).
Aiming for social reintegration of young offenders, detainees and former detainees, the incubator fosters ideas with dynamic lessons on entrepreneurial skills and management.
The IEE seeks to break the cycle of repeat-offending by offering a chance to men and women who are often turned down by society.
The project has earned support from Petrobras since 2006, and has partnered with Ashoka, McKinsey & Company and several universities.
Because of this work, Monteiro was named an Ashoka fellow.

The penitentiary system in Brazil has been repeatedly been a subject of criticism by human rights groups.
A report by Amnesty International in 2010 said detainees “continued to be held in cruel, inhuman or degrading conditions”, often facing overcrowded facilities.
When detainees are released, they carry a heavy stigma, and harsh experiences in jail hardly contribute to rehabilitation.
But with the proper incentive and inspiration, detainees may find options of new paths to rebuild their lives.

Japan: We're Losing to Apple, and Here's Why · Global Voices
When IT consultant, author and developer Isseki Nagae titled an October 11, 2011, post on his blog "Why Japanese manufacturers keep losing to Apple, in the words of Steve Jobs" , he probably knew he would draw some flak for it.
Many of those who came to the post through Hatena, where it was bookmarked over two thousand times, no doubt expected to find some insights from the former Apple CEO on what is wrong with the Japanese electronics industry.
With the iPhone finally making major inroads into the local mobile phone market, and Samsung stealing the spotlight from Japan's legendary gadget-makers, these insights are much in demand.
The post, though, wasn't exactly what its title seemed to imply.
Instead of the words of Steve Jobs on the topic, the post was an opinion piece by Nagae, supported in part by things Steve Jobs had said in other contexts.
iPhone in Japan (by Flickr user nobihaya) Nagae sets the backdrop: It’s not the consumers’ job to know what they want.

Russia: The Future of LiveJournal's Network Effect · Global Voices
On October 12, 2011, the Vedomosti newspaper published an article titled "A Half-Dead Journal" which analyzed the drop in LiveJournal's traffic within the last nine months.
The publication provoked a heated discussion on the credibility of journalists' work, the value of network effect, and the structure of the Russian blogosphere.
Defense of LiveJournal
Svetlana Ivannikova, head of LiveJournal Russia, Demian Kudryavtsev, the managing director of Kommersant Publishing House (one of three main shareholders of the SUP Fabrik, a company that operates LiveJournal) and blogger Anton Nossik (who worked as a 'social media evangelist' at SUP Fabrik in 2006-2008) claimed that Vedomosti did a bad journalistic job and misinterpreted the data.
Ivannikova presented graphs that compared the traffic structure of LiveJournal in 2009 and 2010, which showed that the drop in traffic might indeed be connected with seasonal prevalence.
Why LiveJournal is important
The debates on whether or not LiveJournal was losing its audience have been taking place since mid-2010, as more and more alternative social networks entered the Russian market.
For a long time, LiveJournal has been a platform of choice for many bloggers.
It was so popular among netizens that it got into the spotlight of the Russian big business.
In 2007, it was bought by the Russian businessman Alexander Mamut and minor shareholders (later Mamut sold a significant share to another 'oligarch' Alisher Usmanov and Usmanov-controlled Kommersant Publishing House).
In August 2011, Usmanov and Mamut announced that they would sell SUP (some commenters argued that the Vedomosti article was published on purpose by a potential buyer in order to reduce the price).
The preference of LiveJournal over stand-alone blogs or blogs that didn't have friend connections as one of their core functions has been an important distinguishing feature as compared to other countries' blogospheres.
In 2011, however, the platform experienced DDoS attacks, which pushed some users to establish their presence on alternative social networking platforms, such as Google+ and Facebook.
Among other things, the Vedomosti article noted that LiveJournal's financial structure was non-transparent (as a privately-held company, SUP doesn't have an obligation to share its traffic data or financial statements) and that one of the revenue streams was covert blog ad placements, the market whose size even ad analysts cannot evaluate.
Users confused
The observers of the scandal (it also has another aspect: Kommersant and Vedomosti are two main competitors in the niche of business analysis), however, expressed confusion rather than loyalty to their once preferred platform.

Russia: Networked Volunteers Save Lives of Missing Children · Global Voices
In September 2010, 4-year-old Liza and her aunt disappeared in a forest area outside of Moscow.
Just a few weeks prior to that, fierce wildfires had destroyed forest paths and it was particularly difficult to navigate.
Volunteers who found out about Liza's disappearance used the Internet to distribute an urgent call for help.
A community of car drivers was the first to respond.
Unfortunately, it was too late; Liza and her aunt died alone in a forest.
Liza Alert: Internet-based Volunteer Network
Liza's disappearance and a number of similar cases have triggered the creation of a more organized volunteer community.
Liza's rescuers decided to establish a network whose members would engage immediately once a child was lost.
The network was called Liza Alert in order to commemorate Liza, and a reference to the successful United States-based Amber Alert.
Grigoriy Sergeev, one of the network founders, explains how the network was born:
East Timor: Investing in Creativity and Culture · Global Voices
East Timor is known for its material, musical and dance traditions.
Celebration of "culture" was a crucial part of its resistance to Indonesian occupation from 1975 to 1999, and East Timorese independence has seen a number of emergent cultural projects.
But something that goes overlooked is a strong culture of craft and "making" with locally available materials.
Enter a new project called "Tatoli ba Kultura", meaning "Passing on Culture".
The objective of the project, after extensive research and preparation, will be to support the development of a school of creative industries:
The project aims to create an institution to conserve and protect indigenous culture but also to bring creativity to an educational level in order to create innovation.
The coordinator of the project, David Palazón, is an artist who hails from Barcelona, Spain.
Passing on culture
By chance I came here to have a break with my career, do some volunteering in my field, one thing led to another.
He has been crisscrossing the country with his team researching Timorese material and performance culture, and posting fascinating videos, images and audio on the Tatoli ba Kultura "media map", which is fast becoming a great reference.
Some of the most compelling videos are of musical instruments which are region-specific.
Take for example this video of a musical instrument called Rama from Ataúro Island:
The Timorese context is quite specific, argues Palazón:
Kultura is not quite the same as we understand culture in the western world.
For Timorese, culture is all those things that comes from the past, it's a reference point to understanding where they come from.
My most common question when I do fieldwork is: Why do you do this like this?
And the reply is always the same: 'Because it is the way our ancestors used to do it, and it has been passed on from generations.'
Obviously they have many influences from Indonesia, China, Portugal, etc ... which are also rooted in the inside of the culture and are in practice totally embedded.
He says, in relation to innovation:
Traditionally speaking, Timor is still very much a country dependent on subsistence agriculture, the economy outside the capital is very much dependent on the family, their goods, what they can exchange, their family members and their incomes, and how these are distributed among who they choose in relation to their own traditions and beliefs.
So in a way it is very conservative - not politically speaking - but because changing things implies a serious risk that many people cannot afford Nevertheless inside the traditional system there are people who are more progressive.
Ultimately, Palazón hopes that a school of creative industries would among other things generate employment through the rise of a "creative class", increase small business development, and boost tourism.
Tatoli ba Kultura has the support of Griffiths University in Queensland, Australia and a number of institutional donors.
Palazón paraphrases Griffiths Professor Tony Fry, who says, "Timor has two national resources: oil and culture.
Oil will not last forever, on the contrary, culture will last forever."

The Truth follows several homeless in Bogota, Colombia, who speak about their lives, touching on political, social and economical aspects of homelessness.
One of those interviewed is a 15 year old who tells of his estrangement from his family, his drug addiction, his forays into the most dangerous parts of towns to get drugs and his wish to be able to be "fine" and go home to spend Christmas with his family on the other side of the city:
The House takes us inside the "home" of a homeless person: underneath a manhole cover and into an underground wiring station beneath the streets of downtown Bogota.
There, Darío Acosta has his bed, books, radio, battery powered light and his imaginary dog.
Mark used to be homeless in the 1990s, living on Hollywood Blvd in Los Angeles, addicted to drugs and selling pictures of his iguana to tourists.
Today, he heads the Invisible People project, where he goes around the US and Canada asking homeless to tell their stories and advocating for their rights.
On a visit to Canada, he noticed the connection between the First People and homelessness and he then tried not only to get their stories and show the unique situation faced by them while maintaining cultural sensitivity but also, hopefully, to change their situation:
The following interview is with Dave Ward, director of aboriginal relations at Homeward Trust Edmonton.
This is an important conversation. David talks about aboriginal culture and solutions to ending homelessness.
Too me, I think the biggest is listening.
We need to listen to their culture and include aboriginal people in the process of finding and implementing solutions.
One of the striking interviews is the one featuring Alma.
She's a homeless grandmother in Winnipeg who is putting herself through college in the hope that having an education will empower her and increase her chances of getting back her granddaughter from child protective services as she becomes able to give her a better life:
In Bradford, England, Hope Housing provides opportunities for homeless people who don't classify for benefits, most of them because they are immigrants who no longer have their documents, are unemployed and have to turn to squatting or living on the streets to survive.
Caucasus: Frozen Conflicts, Forgotten Lives? · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage on Refugees. Overshadowed by the conflict in the former Yugoslavia at roughly the same time, the three conflicts waged in the South Caucasus in the early 1990s remain as neglected by the international media as ever.
Over a million people were forced to flee their homes as war broke out between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed territory of Nagorno Karabakh, while nearly half that figure were displaced when Georgia lost control over its two breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia at roughly the same time.
True, a resurgence in fighting over South Ossetia culminating in the war between Georgia and Russia in August 2008 might have made international headlines, but the plight of refugees and IDPs in the South Caucasus rarely does, once ceasefire agreements are signed.
Meanwhile, in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, as well as the breakaway territories of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Nagorno Karabakh, the local media rarely deals with the problems facing refugees and IDP communities unless they can be used to propagandize against the 'enemy.'
Instead, refugees and IDP issues are generally covered by international development and humanitarian organizations themselves, usually in the interest of raising awareness among donors.
Meanwhile, none of the three conflicts show any sign of being resolved in the near future, further casting a shadow over the fate of those displaced by war.

However, as new and social media empowers more people in the region, even if only in terms of access to information, some of the voices of the refugees and IDPs themselves can finally be found online.
An example of this can be found on iDP Voices, a project supported by the Norwegian Refugee Council, the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center, and Panos London.
Containing the stories of 29 IDPs from South Ossetia and Abkhazia collected by interviewers and presented in text and audio form, an electronic version in PDF format is also available for download.
When did you last listen to a displaced person and grasp the impact of displacement?
Did you ever think what it means to lose close family members in conflict, lose all your belongings and to be uprooted from your place of origin?
These direct voices have the power to cut through prejudice and political agendas, they speak for themselves.
The focus is on universal human experiences and responses, not specific political issues.
By reading what the displaced people themselves want to tell us, we may learn what is important to them and what issues they are particularly concerned about.
It allows us to glean the reality behind generalised notions of displacement.
The stories stand alone with little analysis added – their power lies in their offering of images, a voice, sensations, feelings, hopes and dreams.
One such voice is Teah, a 30-year-old Georgian who fled Abkhazia and who says "she dreams of an “ordinary life” for all Georgians and Abkhazians, who must “forgive each other everything."
I try to speak to both Georgians and Abkhazians.
It is impossible to hate each other; we have made enough mistakes without adding that one as well!
We should forgive each other and ourselves too.
And one more thing: there has to be the will on both sides to achieve more trust and good relations.
One party alone cannot solve anything.
I think these borders should be opened so that people can communicate with each other.
Dialogue comes first, that can lead to trust...
Only after talking about our own tragedies did we truly learn about each other and start to love each other.
It took time to trust each other.
It was when we believed that we understood each other’s pain, when this moment came, that we could sit down and talk openly - without aggression, without accusations.
Such narratives told entirely from the first person are rare, however, although there are some exceptions.
For example, international donors have funded the airing of refugee issues on local radio stations although these are often short lived, and one young ethnic Azeri refugee wrote two guest entries for own personal project which also forms part of Global Voices' Caucasus Conflict Voices coverage.
The first was written in English before being voluntarily translated into Armenian, Azerbaijani and Russian:
I was only four when I left Armenia, but in retrospect I don’t know whether that’s fortunate or not as I am unable to remember everything I left behind.
But I do remember our house, our garden, the playground, my friends, my apple tree, and the rooster which I loved so much.
After arriving in Azerbaijan I used to dream about our house and walking in the ruins of our village.
At some point, however, everything just faded away.
Even so, my family have never lost their belief that one day we will go back home.
We believe that two neighbors who have lived together for centuries will come together again even if evil has never left them alone and always whispers hatred.
In Azerbaijan, we kept ourselves apart from the local culture for many years and couldn’t adjust back to our ethnic roots.
Being treated as a stranger made it even more difficult.
Azerbaijanis from Armenia segregated themselves from the rest as a result and united among themselves.
Discrimination towards us was everywhere. It was in the kindergarten I went to, in the primary school, and even in our social life.
This war made me a Peacemaker although I am very new in this area.
My struggle is more complicated, however, because on the one hand I have to help those who are in conflict, and on the other help myself.
But if most refugees and IDPs are deprived of a voice in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, their stories are at least conveyed from time to time in independent media projects online.
One example is a recent blog-based project conducted by the International Center on Conflict and Negotiation (ICCN) and the European Center for Minority Issues (ECMI)-Caucasus.
Originally written in Russian, but also translated and available in English, one post co-penned by an Azerbaijani and Georgian journalist offers an insight into the hopes of refugees and IDPs in their own countries:
“Good neighborhood,” I was told by one refugee from the settlement of Dashalti in Nagorno-Karabkah, “this is when the people live not on the ‘other side’ and are divided by a line, but when they live near and next to one another, when they set up family, they visit one another and national identity does not matter in the least.
For many centuries it was believed that the land belongs to those who live on it, who work on it.
The rest was invented by the politicians.
Experience shows us that those who saw with their own eyes sorrow and worry and felt in their own hearts the trouble of their native country will never accept that it is lost.
But at the same time they never want to repeat the same horrors, and they never strive for war.
All the refugees who talked with us in Azerbaijan want to go back to their small native land and to live peacefully with Armenians.
The sentiment is not peculiar to Azerbaijani refugees and IDPs, and can often be heard from their Armenian counterparts who were also forced to flee during the tit-for-tat expulsions and mutual ethnic cleansing that defined the Karabakh conflict.
However, the reach of such narratives remains small given relatively low Internet penetration and usage in the region.
Television, the main information source for most citizens, remains particularly off-limits for alternative narratives on conflict.
Even so, videos including the stories of refugees and IDPs, such as these on the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict rounded up by Global Voices here and here, are at least available online.
Unfortunately, however, what few projects did exist to empower refugees and IDPs themselves through new and social media do not appear to have succeeded.
Nevertheless, as Internet penetration increases, the potential is there. This post is part of our special coverage on Refugees.

What's more, if the University of Hawaïï had not given Barack Obama Sr. the opportunity to study in the US, his son would probably not be here today.
Immigration debate
A political debate has been going on in France since beginning of September 2011.
Minister of Interior and President Sarkozy's former Chief of Staff, Claude Guéant, signed in May 2011, cojointly with the Minister of Work and Social Relations, Xavier Bertrand, a circular which makes it more difficult for foreign students who have graduated from French public and private universities to work on French territory and thus change their student visa permit into a working visa.

In addition, a decree was signed on September 6, 2011, in order to tighten conditions for foreigners looking to pursue their higher education in France.
Julie Smith, an American citizen living in France was affected by these new policies.
After she received a deportation letter from the authorities, she wrote on French information website Rue 89:
Here is my story of being an American immigrant in France, the story of many as immigration policy has tightened under Interior Minister Claude Guéant.
This policy destroys the lives of many foreigners who have been settled in France and have built their lives here for years.
It deprives France of their real contribution to the economy and is applied in a completely illogical and unjust manner.

The demonstration was organised by the "Collectif du 31 mai", an organisation which gathers foreign students and graduates from French universities. It counts more than 6,000 supporting members on its Facebook page.
"La Confederation Étudiante", the second most important student union in France, has also mobilised on the issue.
The organisation has launched a petition asking the Government to withdraw the measure. It has been signed by more than 2,000 people thus far.
Some international students assume that the May 31 circular is an opportunity for them to go back to their countries and help develop them.

Italy, Senegal: Strong Reactions Follow Murder of 2 Senegalese Men in Florence · Global Voices
On December 14, 2011, at the initiative of Mayor Matteo Renzi, the City of Florence, Italy, decided to suspend all commercial activity for ten minutes as a protest against racism.
Shop owners closed their stores for the entire day in solidarity.
A tragic event that took place in the day before.
On December 13, Gianluca Casseri, a 50 year-old hunter, far-right activist and author of books denying the Holocaust, opened fired on a group of Senegalese in two outdoor markets in Florence.
The horrific event resulted in the death of two street vendors from Senegal, as well as the perpetrator of the crime, who committed suicide after a brief shoot-out with police.
The incident also left three other Africans injured and hospitalized in critical condition.

According to reports of the incident published in the media, the incident created chaos and fear in the very heart of Florence.
It also provoked vehement reactions and speculation as to the motives behind Casseri's killing of two strangers.
Was this a case of racism or insanity?
A video reviews the homicide and provides one Senegalese man's reactions; in his opinion, this was a case of racism.
The video also features comments from members of a far-right group called Casapound, which counted Casseri among its enthusiasts.
Tiziano Rugi commented on the event reporternuovo.it:
Chiara Barisson, an Italian sociologist based in Senegal, handed out 200 flyers in the streets of Sandaga as a way of offering her condolences and apologies, not only to the families of the victims killed in Florence, but to the Senegalese people as a whole.
Surrounded by her Italian friends, she insisted on saying "I'm sorry" for the racist act, said The Observateur.
Shop owners were said to be very touched by the sociologist's gesture.
However this comment on the video from de schwarzeraal puts a different spin on the murderer's act:
Africans from the Ivory Coast have been known to burn their Senegalese neighbors at the stake; one Senegalese man killed an African from Mali over garbage and God knows what else while pretending to be in charge... in the street, a Malian killed a man from Senegal over a place in front of a TV screen, etc...crazy people are everywhere...
On December 17, the outdoor markets of several Italian cities organized protest marches, as reported in one opinion piece on the blog corriereimmigrazione:
Thousands of people turned out last Saturday in Florence in protest at the action of a far-right activitst who killed two street vendors of Senegalese origin last Tuesday.
And this report appeared on the Senegal 24.7 Facebook page:
Senegalese men killed in Florence: protest against racism — At least 10,000 people marched last Saturday in protest against racism in Florence (centre) where a far-right activist shot and killed two street vendors of Senegalese origin last Tuesday, injuring three others.
We want to ring in a new era of hope, so that our two brothers didn't die for nothing, a spokesperson from the Senegalese community, Mr. Pape Diaw, declared to the press.
We must work harder for peaceful coexistence and respect.
It has to become a real battle, and not just a façade, he added.
The number of protesters was estimated to be about 10,000, according to police; the figure 12,000 was reported by protest organizers.
Many wondered whether this was a case of political exploitation or proof of compassion. blogunugalsene.com published posted the following update:
As this goes to press, Me Aïssata Tall Sall is taking part in the protest in Florence, to pay tribute to the memory of the two murdered Senegalese men, with the expected presence of the Italian Prime Minister, the President of the Regional Council, the Democratic Party leader (major opposition to the current governing party).
The lawyer hired by the Socialist Senegalese party will head up a pool of French and American lawyers who will defend the victims.
Tomorrow, December 18th, before leaving Italy, she is scheduled to meet with other Italian lawyers who will also join the pool.
The Italian authorities reacted with strong statements and actions to the tragedy, as did the Senegalese community and Italian civil society.
Russia: Opposition Faces Online Communication Problems · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Russia Elections 2011.
The current political protest is network-based.
Many of its participants, excluded from mainstream politics, are veterans of online battles.
However, as most of them are joining the protest from different perspectives, offline communication between them could have been smoother.
A union against the common enemy, rigged election results, and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's political machine: this is what has brought into one place representatives of Russia's liberal, social-democratic, and nationalist forces.
On December 22, 2011, we saw them creating a coalition decision for the first and, hopefully, not for the last time.
All parties are very interested in legibility (as compared to the sliding legitimacy of the ruling regime) and therefore resort to online tools that would allow to reach a new level of transparency.
Voting for the balanced representation proposed by Alexey Navalny.

The revolution will be both tweeted and televised
And indeed, the protesters are a lot tech-savvier and much more transparent than their counterparts.
The meeting of the organizational committee of the December 24 rally that was held on December 22 was very well live-streamed by rusotv.org, an online live-broadcasting media portal.
The ability to broadcast the events of December 2011 live online has made people around the world and in Russia the spectators of a truly historical event – a gathering of some 100-150 opposition activists, who represented thousands of the netizens and millions of not-connected Russians.
The meeting was moderated by Alexey Navalny, a politician-turned-blogger-turned-political-prisoner-turned-politician.
Next to him were the nationalists (including Dmitry Krylov and Vladimir Tor) and the liberals (including Boris Nemtsov and former chess champion Garry Kasparov), social-democrats, anarchists, environmentalists, unionized car owners, the Pirate Party, and many others.
The key question of the meeting was to decide who would be the host at the December 24 meeting.
It was not just an organizational issue, but the question of whether the different, polarized political groups would manage to find a formula that would suit the majority of the diverse citizen groups.
Earlier, the protesters had decided they would use two tools: the Facebook voting tool and Survey Monkey to let people add their own rally speaker candidates.
Problems, however, emerged with both tools.
Platform bias or ease of rigging?
Denis Bilunov, representative of the "Solidarity" movement and a person responsible for the online polls, presented the results of the popular vote.
Some 83,000 users took part in the Survey Monkey poll, but the results were rather disgruntling: Alexey Navalny came in first, but right after him were a neo-Nazi nicknamed "Tesak" and a fraudster businessman Sergey Mavrodi (both received about 20 percent of the votes).
Bilunov recognized them as rigged (in his opinion, the SurveyMonkey service had been abused by a vote-stuffing bot) and proposed to disregard them.
Aside from these two 'rigged' candidates (participants believed it was used by the authorities to discredit the voting system), the following candidates were on top of the list: Yuri Shevchuk (singer) Leonid Parfenov (journalist) Boris Akunin (writer) Alexander Belov (nationalist politician) Konstantin Krylov (nationalist politician) Dmitry Bykov (poet) Vladimir Tor (nationalist politician) Mikhail Efremov (actor)
It is important to note that in the Top 30 list, four nationalists were on high positions, while on Facebook there was none.
This led to a controversy. An anarchist who called himself Ukrop ('dill' in Russian) stated that these online elections "were as falsified as the official ones."
Boris Nemtsov, leader of Solidarity movement, who had been caught cursing at his political allies, supported this idea.
As one representative proposed: "Let an IT guy create a program that would make 2,000 votes in a few minutes and let everyone see how easy it's to cheat online with such voting."
The option of using SurveyMonkey in the future seemed to be recognized as flawed.
Then Bilunov proposed to use either Facebook or Democracy2.ru (an e-democracy platform created by the author of "Cloud Democracy" concept Leonid Volkov).
Geidar Djemal had a Bolshevik-style proposal of choosing delegates based on their "political suitability" and not on poll results.
The nationalists, however, didn't like Facebook voting, claiming there were "only liberals" there, and that the choice of the platform would have a significant impact on the outcome of the voting.
Ilya Ponomarev, one of the creators and main ideologists of the open voting, defended the results, saying that despite controversy, this was still the most massive online poll ever conducted in Russia.
Navalny formula
The option proposed by Alexey Navalny seemed to have aggregated all options expressed by the speakers.
He followed those speakers who proposed a mixed approach: the majority of the speakers (mostly celebrities: actors, journalists, writers, and even the former USSR president Mikhail Gorbachev, whom he described as "inherently liberal") are those who are on top of both the SurveyMonkey and Facebook lists, given they will attend the December 24 protest, plus the representatives from political groups: 2-3 persons from the nationalists (the speakers will be selected by Dmitry Krylov and Vladimir Tor), 2-3 from the leftists (selected by Ilya Ponomaryov and Sergey Udaltsov).
The voting, assembled after some major shouting, showed: 80 persons for Navalny's option, 32 against. The decision passed.
Those who participated decided to form a new political body that would unite the anti-government effort and continue the protests against the elections.

Russia: Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the 2012 Presidential Election · Global Voices
Formerly Russia's richest man, jailed oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky is once again in the political spotlight, as Russian presidential candidate Mikhail Prokhorov vows to pardon Mr. Khodorkovsky if he's elected next spring.
Mr. Khodorkovsky has been incarcerated since 2003, when he was arrested for non-payment of back-taxes as part of the "Yukos Affair".
Many have doubted the validity of the charges against him and view his prosecution as part of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's political agenda.
In a November 16, 2011, post entitled "FC Anzhi and the Yeltsin Era Money," Global Voices described Russia's economy since the fall of the Soviet Union, the origin of the "oligarchs," as well as Putin's attempts to control and direct their activities:
The Yeltsin era of the 1990s was characterized by a struggle over who would emerge from the transition with holdings of Russia's major sources of wealth, such as its natural resources.
The victors in that struggle are known as the ‘oligarchs' because they possess a degree of wealth that surpasses most people's ability to conceptualize.
Vladimir Putin's rise has had unexpected effects on the power of the oligarchs in that he has been able to enforce limitations on them and to direct their activities.
The early Putin years marked a divide between the oligarchs who fell in line with Putin's wishes and those who didn't.
During this time Mr. Khodorkvsky, CEO of the oil giant Yukos, was praised by international organizations for being the first of Russia's elite to make public his financial records; he met with world leaders, he engaged in well-publicized domestic relief efforts, and he mentioned running for president in 2008.
Mr. Khodorkovsky was then arrested in 2003 and his assets were seized.
Pavel Khodorkovsky, Mikhail's son, wrote in a blog associated with CNN on November 15 about his father's 2003 arrest and incarceration.
It’s been eight years since Vladimir Putin’s thugs forcibly removed my father, Mikhail, from a plane and took him to prison.
The last time I saw him was a few weeks before his arrest, when he was visiting me at college in Boston.
There were already concerns about his safety in Russia; his business partner, Platon Lebedev, had been locked up earlier that summer.
And despite the urging of American friends and colleagues to stay here, my father remained firm and returned home.
In the intervening eight years, after enduring two show trials and countless other indignities – all while the international community’s condemnation of his imprisonment fell on deaf ears within the corrupt Russian regime – my father has not given up hope.
Even as the term of his first sentence ended two weeks ago – and, therefore, by all accounts, he should be set free – he remains optimistic.
He is encouraged that in the last few months, the chorus of those who denounce his imprisonment has grown louder.
In May Amnesty International declared him a prisoner of conscience.
Then the European Court of Human Rights ruled that he was not afforded fair hearings and had been subjected to degrading conditions in court and in prison.
This fall the International Bar Association concluded that his second trial was unfair, based on “mistake-ridden and self-contradictory” charges that were at odds with the Russian criminal code.

Khodorkovsky's life story has been immortalized by a 2011 documentary film.
Samuel Rubenfeld wrote in a blog associated with the Wall Street Journal about the film:
German filmmaker Cyril Tuschi directed the film, which Corruption Currents saw at a special press screening on Nov. 3.
He began with painting a picture of the Wild West landscape of post-Soviet Russia. Graft ruled, and it still does: The World Justice Project’s 2011 Rule of Law Index (pdf) warned of a lack of checks and balances in Russian government, leading to “an institutional environment characterized by corruption, impunity and political interference.”
Such was the case of Khodorkovsky, according to the film, which features the first interview with the man since his detention.
There were issues with finding Russian theaters willing to screen the film, and in the interview Tushci was asked to discuss that process.
This post was published on November 29, which was days before the controversial parliamentary elections, and yet this film maker, who had a limited understanding of the Russian language or Russian culture, as he indicated earlier in the interview, seemed to be aware of something ominous.
He seemed to be aware of a powerful link between Putin and Khodorkovsky:
I’m very surprised that they are so open-speaking about it.
They don’t screen it out of self-censorship.
I don’t think…that the Kremlin said, “Don’t do it.”
I think the cinema owners fear state revenge if they would do it.
Very simple.
Tax inspections.
Not enough fire doors, so you get a fine of a million or something silly like that.
But maybe it’s just inherited in their genes the authoritarian character.
Not in everybody.
I’m very happy people are changing, and the air is changing in the last 72 hours.
It changed a lot.
Something’s happening, and it’s not only the film.
The film’s only triggering something that’s already in the air.
All the…approval for Putin is going down.
People are criticizing and laughing at Putin on live TV, and this wouldn’t have happened before.
Something is changing and I’m curious what will happen.

In a December 16 post, the Khodorkovsky and Lebedev Communications Center announced how the upcoming Russian presidential election could affect Khodorkovsky's fate:
Mikhail Prokhorov, the Russian billionaire who plans to challenge Vladimir Putin in Russia's presidential election said that his first move if elected will be to pardon Mikhail Khodorkovsky .
The post went on to cite a Wall Street Journal article, which quoted Putin's response to whether he would be equally willing to free Mr. Khodorkovsky if he were to win the election:
"Freeing Khodorkovsky is the president's right. For the pardon to happen, Khodorkovsky would have to write an appeal for a pardon, and effectively assume the guilt, which he hasn't done so far.
If he writes it, the pardon will be possible by law.
If Khodorkovsky writes such an appeal, I will consider it, but I will have to become the president for that first."
A Russian-language blog devoted to Mr. Khodorkovsky's cause cited a Gazeta.ru article in their December 2 post :
Thailand: Survival and Creativity During Floods · Global Voices
The situation in Thailand is improving as floodwaters are receding but the death toll has now reached more than 600, according to Saksith Saiyasombut:
Now that the worst seems to be over and the tide are slowly, but steady receding in many parts of the country, a sense of normalcy returns to Bangkok.
However, the suffering for many in the affected areas continue, there’s still conflict along the barriers and the death toll is now over 600.
Ladprao64 also observes that life is getting back to normal in many places:
Although many people are still struggling with flooded homes and workplaces on the vicinity of Bangkok, further north and some areas of the city itself, our little patch is getting back to normal.
We went to Central Ladprao on Saturday – it had opened the day before – and had no real difficulty getting there.
There was some water near the SCB Plaza and cars were using the two outside lanes but the inside ones would have been passable if necessary.
Apart from that, there was plenty of mud to show where the water had reached and the place is going to look rather shabby for a while.
The flood disaster in Thailand is the worst in the past five decades in terms of human casualties and damages in properties and infrastructures.
But the disaster which flooded majority of the provinces for several weeks, including parts of Bangkok, also showed the inventive ways of people as they coped with the floods.
Thai Flood Hacks is a Tumblr account which gathers the interesting flood devices and approaches which were created by ordinary residents to survive the floods.
For example, below is an improvised boat made of plastic tubs:
Worried about parking in flooded buildings?
Below is some unique motorbike parking:
And car bags protect these vehicles:
Below is a water bottle swimming vest for cats:
This amphibious pickup truck seems ready for the flooded roads:
Universities also helped in manufacturing devices that could help save lives during the flooding.
A popular example is the FloodDuck which gives a warning of electric current in the floodwater:
Clarice Africa identifies several crowdsourcing applications which provide useful information to residents.
An example is the website Is my house flooded?, “where Bangkok residents who evacuated their respective homes can simply enter their postal address and find out the flood situation near their homes.”
Here’s a story of dog rescuers and volunteers as they search and help stranded dogs in the city:
We found several dogs in deserted houses & garages that were perched on floating cars.
It was evident that they had not eaten in days.
These dogs were terrified & our rescuers struggled to catch them with their nets & bare hands.
We also found puppies stranded on a pile of floating rubbish who were delighted to see us & promptly jumped in our boat where they enjoyed some food & affection.
Their mother was in deep water nearby & although terrified, we finally managed to rescue her also.
Zambia: Has the 90 Days Promise Been Fulfilled? · Global Voices
Zambia’s President Michael Sata’s government reached its landmark 90 days in government on December 23, a period his Patriotic Front party promised it would turn around people’s lives and improve general governance.
Sata’s defeated the MMD which had been in power for 20 years after promising the electorate more money in their pockets and delivery of a new constitution, among other things, in 90 days.
Netizens on various social networking sites have been assessing the new government’s achievements, if any, and failures.
Satire columnist, Kalaki’s Corner, captured an imaginary exchange between the president and the first lady:
Artistic depiction of Michael Sata as Zambia's Black Moses.
Image source: 90 Days Countdown Facebok group.
I had nearly finished my toast and marmalade when he finally appeared, flicking specks of invisible dust from his lapel.
‘Good morning, darling,’ I said.
‘If you say so,’ he replied.
‘What’s in the papers this morning?’
‘The Boast has got a long editorial…’
‘That’s nothing new,’ he chuckled, ‘It always has a long editorial.
Nobody to edit the editor, that’s the problem.’
‘Ninety days of broken promises.’
‘What did you say dear?’
‘That’s the title of the editorial.
Ninety days of broken promises.’
‘Would you mind, my dear,’ he replied, ‘pouring me a cup of tea.’
‘Ninety days of broken promises,’ I repeated, as I poured him a cup to tea.
‘Who’s been breaking their promises?’
‘You, my dearest.
He’s talking about you.’
He hung his head for a moment.
Then looked up, and looked me straight in the eye. I’m very worried.
Everybody will be talking about it.’
On the Facebook group, Zambia People’s Parliament (ZAPP), the 90-day promise did not escape debate by the “Honourable Members”.
One member, Sidique Abdullah Gondwe Geloo, suggested a public march with people expressing their personal experience in the three months of the new government:
Mr Speaker sir,after much consultative counsel with both people of high profile and laymen, I proposed and stick to the following"The 90Days Promise Progress Check Match."
They campaigned, we listened; they promised, we believed; elections came, we voted.
Now we ask, "How far have we come?"
Join us in a Match to mark the 90days of PF in power.
Bring your placard, happy or sad.
Share your views, popular or unpopular."
Do I believe this match will yield fruit?
In more ways than one.The government will get the message that we as a people are nolonger the gullible bunch that they feel can tremble or fear to stand up against false promises made.
On another Facebook group, The 90 days Countdown, Ebron Ngoma dismissed calls for a march:
My experiences in Zambia with demos. No one takes particula attention to detail as to why they are protesting.
Today We are making noise about 90days ,so far no one has come up with a clear list of what pf promised to deliver in 90days.
We need to be more inteligent than merely exciting pipo.
Am a firm believer of making a politician accountable and no one wil ever change my views on accountability.
If we dont have a list of the promises, we are as gud as leting it pass.
A list of promises pipo, then am in.
We need a clear roadmap on how we whant to do this, not just excitement.
A youth who refuses to learn from the past will never be guaranteed of success.
Lets NOT DEMOSTRATE because we want to, we need a CLEAR OBJECTIVE,then you will have the whole Zambian youth with you on that day.
Politicians cannot be fought by shadow boxing-they must know that we are watching with intelegence.I INSIST -A LIST OF PF PROMISES vs ACHIEVEMENTS.
Most of the readers’ reactions to a story on the Zambian Watchdog quoting Information Minister Given Lubinda, the Chief Government Spokesman, saying that the Vice President Guy Scott would present a statement to Parliament detailing the achievements of the PF government in the first 90 days of its rule, did not spare government on backtracking on its campaign promises.
One reader, Pimbi Mano wrote:
Mr Lubinda,please let the Zambians be the judges of your performance.You can not be your own judge and jury,the Zambia people have the right to analyse your performance in the last 90 days and give you a mark.
My mark so far is 1% just for keeping Zambia so far-but you have failed the rest.Your Cabinet is the worst since independence.Nobody knows what your long-term policies are.
The only people who know what you are trying to do are the kaponyas -who have no idea of what they are doing in the first place.
Theb economy is in danger of not growing as fast as it grew in in the last 5 years.
Look at the Zambian kwacha and see how it is doing.How real jobs have you created so far-noone.The truth is that you will not create any jobs during the next five years.
Your foreign policy is a mess.Angola,Malawi and evening Mozamabique are really not happy with you.
You said you did not want any investment from China and now you are talking to China.
Mr Lubinda,please do not waste your time with a parliamentary statement-Zambians everywhere are watching.Remember every dog has its time.
However, one reader, Twesheko supported the PF government:
I am so surprised people made a big thing out of the 90 days remark.
Seriously, how can you believe in such political statements?
This was just an empty political statement – the PF is in power not because of the 90 day thing – actually, the Vice President should not even say anything about achieving promisses in 90 days – this is because PF won as result of the long term strategic plans that they have outlined in their manifesto which you will start seeing in the 2013 budget.
So far so good.
Mineral Royalty tax has increase, there is Tax Relief on PAYE, cleaning up the fuel procurement process – fuel reduced, minimum wage to be revised per sector in consultation with all – the 90 days have been useful but are not the most important thing.
There were also questions about the 90 day promise on Twitter.
One such entry read:
@sandakc: Michael Sata gave himself a 90-day honeymoon to turn #Zambia around, a deadline that expires Friday.
Has he delivered on his 90-day promise?

Ethiopia: Swedish Journalists Found Guilty of Terrorism Charges · Global Voices
Two Swedish journalists, Johan Persson and Martin Schibbye, were found guilty on Wednesday 21 December, 2011, of supporting terrorism in Ethiopia and entering the country illegally.
Jesper Bengtsson, chair of the Swedish section of Reporters Without Borders, commented on the verdict on Swedish Public Radio:
I had hoped, and I think everyone had hoped, that the Ethiopian authorities had already made an example of Persson and Schibbye by starting the trial process and jailing them for six months.
Obviously that wasn't enough of an example.
Journalist Martin Schibbye (right) ©Kontinent Agency AB, used with permission.
Early on Wednesday morning, Judge Shemsu Sirgaga denied the defense's main argument, which held that Schibbye and Persson travelled professionally and had a journalistic duty to report on the conflict from the side of the rebel forces as well as that of Ethiopia's military, and sided with the prosecution.
Sirgaga commented that the Swedes had "used their profession as a cover for terrorist activities" and called for an 18-year prison sentence to be handed down on 27 December, despite Schibbye and Persson's background in reporting from dangerous parts of the world and the testimony by two of Schibbye's and Persson's colleagues, freelance journalists Adrian Blomfield and Phillip Ittner, who had been flown into the capital Addis Ababa to take part in the court proceedings.
During the trial, Schibbye and Persson admitted to entering Ethiopia illegally embedded with the rebels, but denied any charges of supporting terrorism.
In November, the pair were acquitted of the third charge against them, of being "members of a terrorist group".
"Political prisoners"
Mattias Göransson, the editor-in-chief of Filter magazine - the only client of Schibbye and Persson's to publicly acknowledge it had been in touch with the pair before their African trip - was called as a witness during the trial, and expressed disappointment with the verdict when interviewed by Reuters in Sweden:
When the judge read out the grounds it sounded positive, he had virtually nothing against them.
Everything he said was speaking for an acquittal, and then he found them guilty anyway.
This indicates they are political prisoners and nothing else.
The case against Schibbye and Persson has brought further attention to Ethiopia's vague anti-terrorist legislation, under which over 100 opposition leaders and journalists have been jailed up to 20 years.
Three Ethiopian journalists are currently on trial for terrorism charges.
The Swedish section of Amnesty International said it is critical of Ethiopia's arbitrary interpretation of the anti-terror legislation.
Lise Bergh, the General Secretary, said she is convinced of Schibbye and Persson's innocence :
Amnesty International does not believe there is any evidence of the men supporting the ONLF or its operations, nor that they are guilty of any criminal act.
We regard Johan Persson and Martin Schibbye as prisoners of conscience, as they have been prosecuted due to their legitimate work as journalists.
Until the day of the verdict's announcement, the Swedish government had been fairly silent on the case.
Carl Bildt, the foreign minister, had referred to methods of quiet diplomacy when asked about how the Swedish Foreign Ministry were working for the release of the journalists.
The situation has been further complicated by Bildt's personal history.
Until 2006, when Bildt was appointed foreign minister, he served as a board member of Lundin Petroleum, the Swedish oil company whose activities Schibbye and Persson were intending to investigate in the Ogaden province.

After the verdict was announced, Bildt commented on the case on Twitter:
@carlbildt: Sweden expresses grave concern over hard sentence against Swedish journalists in Ethiopia.
We will continue to work to set them free.
Bildt's comment was followed by a statement from Fredrik Reinfeldt, the Swedish prime minister:
Our position is and continues to be that they were in the country on a journalistic assignment.
They must be released as soon as possible in order to be reunited with their families in Sweden.
At an afternoon press conference , Bildt stated that high-level diplomacy was now the prioritized course of action:
We are now making sure that the prime minister's strong message gets through to the Ethiopian government.
We will then reason with the parties involved over the formal steps to be taken in this process.
A mellow reception awaited the official statements in social media.
Under the hashtag #EthiopiaSwedes, tweets were sent out blaming the Swedish authorities for what is perceived as several months of perceived inertia regarding the case.
Twitter user @tommyskot asked:
@tommyskot: When will @sweden and @carlbildt do something to get our journalists home? #EthiopiaSwedes
Below is a sample of reactions from Twitter:
@annalindberg: Now we begin to understand what conditions African journalists are working under. #ethiopiaswedes
@sweden: I'm shocked and appalled by the verdict against #ethiopiaswedes @hurriya: spread this initiative to build solidarity for #ethiopiaswedes http://www.facebook.com/freejohanandmartin #svpol

An alternative route may be to seek a pardon from the Ethiopian state.
Georgia: Return of the Meskhetian Turks · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage on Refugees. The repatriation of the Meskhetian Turks to Georgia from Azerbaijan, Russia and Central Asia is not just a priority for the Georgian government, but also an obligation it has had to fulfill to the Council of Europe since becoming a member in 1999.
Over 100,000 people were deported by Stalin in 1944, from the Meskheti region of Georgia, among them Hemshin (Muslim Armenians), Kurds, and Karapapakhs.
By far the largest group relocated, however, were the Meskhetian Turks.
At least 400,000 Meskhetian Turks now live outside of Georgia, although it has been unclear how many would return in a process that should have officially ended last year, but which might be extended.
This has been one of the reasons why the process of resettlement has taken so long, especially as ethnic Armenians now make up the majority population in what is now the Samtskhe-Javakheti region.
As a result, in order not to strain inter-ethnic relations, the Georgian government is settling Meskhetian Turks throughout the country.
East of Center recently touched upon the sensitivities surrounding the issue:
Thanks to Stalin’s paranoia, millions of Muslims and members of various non-Slavic ethnic groups in the Soviet Union were forcibly relocated to Central Asia during the ’30s and ’40s.
It’s hard to think of any of these communities that has been victimized more often and so thoroughly ignored by the wider world as the Meskhetian Turks.
Clearly, however, Georgia is not capable of resettling that large a population anywhere on its territory, much less the underdeveloped Samtskhe-Javakheti region where the Meskhetians originally lived.
And then there is the Armenian question, and a large dose of anti-Muslim feeling.

However, in a two-year application period ending in July 2010, the Georgian government received only 5,841 eligible applications according to the European Center for Minority Issues (ECMI).
This amounted to just 9,350 individuals.
Ahıska Türkleri – Ahıskalılar explains what the Meskhetian Turks hope for:
We want to return our lands from which we were expelled unjustly.
As of today, we have been settling down in 2000 different settlements at 9 different countries including USA.
We have difficulty in getting citizenship, settlement permission and work permission in the countries where we live.
Our culture and language is on the edge of vanishing.
We want to return our country as Georgian citizens and to live in our lands from now on.

Last year, Zaka Guluyev's Blog detailed the situation of some of those that have returned, mainly from Azerbaijan, to Samtskhe-Javakheti:
Muslim Arifov and his family has come back to Akhiltskhe three years ago from Saatly, settlement of Azerbaijan.
Arifov says that now he feels happy coming back and live in his motherland Georgia.
“My parents were unfairly deported from this region.
Now I’m happy that I managed to come back and live in my home Georgia with my family.”
Two months ago Muslim’s relative Mehemmed Rehimov also decided to come back with his family from Azerbaijan and to live in his motherland Akhlstkhe.
Mehemmed Rehimov says that Georgia seems better place to live in.
“It’s very good sense to live in my motherland Georgia. two months already past after my coming to Georgia.
I’m happy here with my family and I’m feeling myself very well”.
Ismayil Moidze, the chairman of the society says that, their organization was expecting more people to apply for returning.
But he explains that many families refused to apply because many documents are required for applying repatriat status in Georgia.
That’s why many families decided to stay where they live”.

Georgian Youth _BAR_ Multiculturality _BAR_ New Challenges looks at how the new arrivals are reintegrating:
In Samstkhe-Javakheti, the regional association “Toleranti” provides families of repatriated Meskhetians with legal counseling, medical assistance and language support.
In the frame of its 3-year project “Provision of humanitarian assistance to repatriate Meskhs and prevention of “self-repatriation”, the association noticeably organizes classes for young repatriated Meskhetians twice a week.
Youth who attend the classes hope to improve their chances of success at school, where they receive tuition in Georgian, and to support their integration in the community.
Considering how motivated they are to learn Georgian, and as quickly as possible, this integration is usually 100% successful.
As many others however, one thing prevents them from totally feeling home in Georgia: they are waiting for an answer to their application for the Georgian citizenship, which they sent two years ago.
Without citizenship, they are not fully-fledged citizens in Georgia, and therefore struggle to have access to basic services like medical assistance.
They have no choice, though: just like the others, they have to wait – this means a life of uncertainty in the long-term…

Where's Keith comments on the work of Georgian journalist and photographer Temo Bardzimashvili who has been documenting the return of the Mskhetian Turks to Georgia as well as their lives in Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkey.
Some of Bardzimashvili's work, “The Unpromised Land – the Meskhetians’ Long Journey Home,” was exhibited in Tbilisi, sponsored by the European Centre for Minority Issues (ECMI), and accompanies this post with kind permission.

Global Online Community Protests U.S. Anti-Piracy Bills · Global Voices
Today, January 18, is an important day for the Internet.
Corporate websites, from Google to Twitpic, along with civil society groups and individuals, have all joined together in a common cause: to protest two American bills that could have grave effects for global online free expression.
As Global Voices' Executive Director Ivan Sigal has written, "there are powerful corporate and government forces who would prefer to see the openness and accessibility of the web restricted."
The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect-IP Act (PIPA) would both force websites to pro-actively censor potentially copyrighted information, and could, as Sigal wrote, "inflict broad damage on the work of digital activists living under repressive regimes, as well as restrict basic speech freedoms around the world."
Because these bills have the potential to affect Internet users worldwide, members of the global community have joined Americans in protest.
From German digital rights group Netzpolitik to Open Media Canada to individual bloggers and social media users, the sentiment is the same: Stop these bills.
Blacking out
French site https://linuxfr.org goes dark against #SOPA
Many sites have chosen to express their opposition by blacking out their sites, either entirely or with an interstitial page.
Danica Radovanovic (@DanicaR), writing for Australian blog network DejanSEO, discusses Wikipedia's decision to join the blackout, a decision that affects the site's diverse global community:
Over the course of the past 72 hours, over 1800 Wikipedians have joined together to discuss proposed actions that the community might wish to take against SOPA and PIPA.
This is by far the largest level of participation in a community discussion ever seen on Wikipedia, which illustrates the level of concern that Wikipedians feel about this proposed legislation.
The overwhelming majority of participants support community action to encourage greater public action in response to these two bills.
Of the proposals considered by Wikipedians, those that would result in a “blackout” of the English Wikipedia, in concert with similar blackouts on other websites opposed to SOPA and PIPA, received the strongest support.
French organization La Quadrature du Net has joined its American counterparts in blacking out its website, displaying the following image:
The Pirate Party of Catalunya blacks out in solidarity
Pirate parties are among the most stringent opponents of the anti-piracy bills.
In Spain, Catalunya, Switzerland, Argentina, Canada, and Sweden (among, almost certainly, many others), local pirate parties have joined in blacking out their websites.
Also blacking out for January 18 are Germany's Chaos Computer Club and Green Party, and international organization Reporters Without Borders.
The latter explained its decision, writing:
We have decided to close our English-language website for 24 hours to symbolize the oppressive gag that would spread over the Internet as we know it if SOPA and PIPA are adopted.
These bills would affect an incalculable number of Internet users who are innocent of any kind of intellectual property violation by forcing websites to block access to other sites suspected of vaguely-defined copyright breaches.
For more images of sites blacking out in protest, check out Netzpolitik's SOPA blackout gallery.
Translating the importance of activism
In some countries, bloggers have taken it upon themselves to educate their communities about the importance of opposing SOPA and PIPA.
Lebanese blogger Mireille Raad has written an explanation for why Lebanese citizens should care about these bills.
She writes:
Being a lebanese, doesn’t stop you from being an internet user – the SOPA will affect the internet in a bad way and it involves websites outside the US, and that’s yours... ...You should care and be pissed of, because, like it or not, the internet doesn’t exist in the clouds, it is made of companies that exist in countries and have to answer to local laws despite the fact that internet is “global”.
This fact is making people worldwide care about the SOPA legislation – and even though you may feel powerless, you still should care and take online action – because all citizens in cyberspace are created equal and so their actions resonate equally
An earlier post Taiwanese freedom of information activist CK Hung dubs the anti-piracy bills "The Great Firewall of Chinamerica."
In a graphic , the blogger demonstrates his point:
Edit: An English version of the graphic is also available:
He also writes:
I really do hope #SOPA and #PIPA bills aren't passed through the senate.
Legislation against piracy is needed, but that really isn't the way

Nepal: Not a Territory of India! · Global Voices
…not to forget the Nepal territory because Nepal territory is also a part of India…
A recent remark by a moderator of an Indian TV channel had outraged many Nepalis who vented their reactions on different social networking sites.
In a movie review show ETC Bollywood Business anchor and movie analyst Komal Nahta made a statement that Nepal is also part of India while explaining the box office collection for the blockbuster Bollywood movie DON 2.
The video on YouTube posted below also follows a clarification statement by ETC networks on the statement made by Mr. Nahta:
It became a much talked issue on social networks this week and has once again fuelled debate on Nepal-India relations.
As matters got intense online, especially on Twitter mentioning Komal Nahta (@KomalNahta) while discussing his statement, he had to tweet a clarification article and also had to write a convincing blog post by holding his same values.
It was surprising that Komal did not regret his statement on his blog post.
Rather to justify his point, he further claimed those who made such statements were just irate citizens and hardly knew about his business point.
He further added:
Probably, most of the Nepali citizens who created a controversy where none existed, weren’t even aware that Nepal is, in fact, counted as part of India for the express purpose of counting the domestic shares of Bollywood films.
His attitude in responding to others' tweets was also questionable.
Lex Limbu writes:
When I heard that, I felt uneasy as well.
But then I wondered why a grown man, who surely is educated would say such a nothing.
After fishing for clarifications Komal Nahta took to twitter and justified himself .
Fair enough, maybe he did have a point for saying that, but it's annoying now that the millions of geographically challenged Indian viewers will now think that Nepal is actually a territory of India (oh no). It was not just blog posts and website articles on the issues; some YouTube videos were also made against the reporter’s statement. Watch this episode on the topic:
http://youtu.be/xI9BeNHH2_g
This is not the first time that such a controversy has aroused Nepalis to speak against it.
In 1998, Madhuri Dixit, popular Bollywood actor had to apologise when she said that Nepal was once a part of India.
Again in 2000, Hrithik Roshan, another Bollywood actor had to clarify that he had never stated that he hated Nepal and its people.
The Hrithik and Madhuri's case was also covered by BBC News saying, "Movie theatres across Nepal have suspended screening Indian films after an alleged anti-Nepal slur by a Bollywood star."
Recently in a comedy show Stephen Colbert made fun of Nepali identity and culture, which had aroused similar discussions on social media.
I commented in my own blog post:
My view on the topic is that be it film business calculations or industry norm or whatever, it is indeed a blasphemous error.
If it’s industry norms, the reporter should have mentioned that clearly in his show.
Black Women in European Politics: from Struggle to Success · Global Voices
Nowadays, it is a common occcurence to witness African-born women having successful careers in Europe.
Despite the evident challenges, many of them have also distiguished themselves in politics. Still, it was not so long ago that such success would have seemed impossible.
To achieve greatness, these women have often come a long way, both literally and figuratively.
In order to better appreciate the progress made, one needs to think back to the 19th century and consider the image of black women in Europe then.
For the purpose of this article, we will only address the story of women from the African diaspora who have been elected to positions of leadership in countries other than the colonial powers that previously ruled their home countries.
A history of racism Postcard depicting Sarah Baartman, Wikipedia (public domain) The story of the "Hottentot Venus" is symptomatic of the relationship between the West and African women in the last two centuries.
Sébastien Hervieu, an Africa correspondent for Le Monde newspaper in France, tells the story of Sarah Baartman from South Africa, better known as the "Hottentot Venus".
In an article published in October 2010 in his blog afriquedusud.blog.lemonde.fr, he reviews Abdellatif Kechiche's film about her tragic story, Black Venus:
In response to ongoing abuses of women’s rights, Ayaan Hirsi Ali and her supporters established the AHA Foundation in 2007 to help protect and defend the rights of women in the West from oppression justified by religion and culture.
Italy
The first black person to be elected to the Italian parliament is Mercedes Lourdes Frias from the Dominican Republic, in the Caribbean.
This is how she is described on the blogging site Black Women in Europe:
Mercedes Lourdes Frias was born in the Dominican Republic.
She was the first black person elected to the Italian Parliament in 2006 where she served through April 2008.
She was a member of the Commission on Constitutional Affairs and the Parliamentary Committee on the Implementation of the Control of Schengen Agreement, and the Control and Surveillance on Immigration.
She works on anti-racist activities and welcoming immigrants.
From 1994 1997 she was a member of the Council of the Federation of Protestant Churches in Italy.
In the town of Empoli Ms Frias served a councilor for the environment, rights of citizenship, equal opportunities.
The most surprising of the black women to have been elected via universal sufferage or appointed to positions of elevated responsibility in European countries is Sandra Maria (Sandy) Cane, elected in 2009 on a Northern League ticket; the most racist and xenophobic of Italy's political parties.
One of the party's objectives is the secessoin of some of the northern part the Italian peninsula (though the boundary is not clearly undefined) because the party leaders do not like Southern Italians. The blog stranieriinitalia.it (foreigners in Italy) gives a brief outline of her career :
China: A Guangdong Village on the Verge of a Brutal Crackdown · Global Voices
Since September 2011, hundreds of villagers from Wukan village in Guangdong's Lufeng city have begun demonstrating against illegal land acquisition and last week, armed police entered the village and arrested a number of protest organizers.
Yesterday, it was revealed that a leader of the protesting villagers, Xue Jinbo, was found dead in a police detention center three days after his arrest.
Police claimed that he had a heart attack, but his family say Xue was tortured to death.
While the villagers are outraged by the suspected murder of Xue and are prepared to carry on struggles with local authorities, many concerned netizens worry that the incident will develop into bloody repression.
According to reports from Hong Kong newspapers, the piece of collective land involved is worth more than RMB 700 million.
On September 22, Hong Kong developer Chan Man Ching, along with a large number of local gangsters, forcibly entered the village and beat up the protestors.
Thousands of villagers then surrounded the Lufeng county government building on November 21, and local authorities promised villagers that the dispute would be settled village representatives re-elected within 15 days.
However, when the deadline arrive, instead of fulfilling its promise, the local government took action to arrest protest organizers beginning December 3.
In response, the villagers placed the village Communist Party Committee office under siege on December 5.
On December 10, thousands of villagers blocked the road to the village upon receiving the news that the police would take action in making widespread arrests.

Saudi Arabia: A Family Living in a Cemetery · Global Voices
Away from the political scene and on a more human level, a short movie shot by young Saudi filmmaker Bader AlHomoud named "Almagbarah," which translates to cemetery in Arabic, has changed the life of a Saudi family.
Bader describes the montage phase in his tweet : Today I got depressed while editing a movie that will make you all depressed too
The three-minute movie, posted below from YouTube, shows a Saudi family living in a cemetery.
It has no script, nor a dialog. It features members of the family and their children playing around the cemetery and the abject poverty they live in.
Saudi tweeps were emotionally touched by the movie and below are some of their reactions under the hashtag #ma8barah.
@MarwanAlrouqi describes the logic behind the location : Dear Saudi citizen, for your convince we picked you a residence that is far away from the noise and close to your resting place!

@hayaalshatti asks :
Woe to those who robbed them of their dignity!
And in reaction to the video, which has been watched more than 148,000 times on YouTube, smartman7779 says : This is sad, I cried watching it!
Thank God for my circumstances
Three hours after publishing the movie, Princess Ameerah Al-Taweel, who is Vice-Chairwoman of the Board of Trustees and Head of the Executive Committee of the Al-Waleed bin Talal Foundations, announced on her Twitter account:

Brazil: Cultural Debate as 'Oh if I Catch You' Song Goes Global · Global Voices
If you keep track of the latest international trends in music, if you are really fond of Brazilian music or if for instance you are a Cristiano Ronaldo supporter, you have probably heard the song 'Ai se eu te pego'.
Or perhaps its English version, 'Oh if I catch you'.
Brazilian singer Michel Teló has begun the year of 2012 with a major worldwide success with this song.
Surprisingly or not, Brazilian netizens have been critical towards Teló’s music to show a certain concern about the international view of Brazilian music these days.
'Ai se eu te pego' has made his way to the top of the international billboards with record-high marks of downloads on iTunes.
The most impressive marks are definitely in Europe, where Teló has reached number one in Portugal, Italy and Spain, countries where he will soon present his hit song in his first international tour.

From Brazil to Telobalization
Michel Teló, 30 years old, represents sertanejo universitário (university sertanejo), the newest subgenre of 'sertanejo', a musical genre with roots in the caipira culture of south-central Brazil.
Football players have adopted the song for celebrating goals.
Brazilian footballer Neymar (of Santos F.C.) has even appeared on the videoclip.
Marcelo Vieira and Cristiano Ronaldo (of Real Madrid C.F.) celebrated a goal dancing the song's choreography in October 2011.
Europe in crisis (feat. Michel Teló)
Others are making very creative versions of Teló's music, such as the following video, adapting the lyrics to say "Troika, Troika, you're gonna kill me", in a complaint against the austerity policies impacting the lives of Portuguese citizens imposed by the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and European Commission:
The Europe crisis seems to be a common joke take on Teló's music.
Some suggest this might be the reason for his success in the continent.

South Korea: Activist Indicted for Retweeting North Korean Messages · Global Voices
South Korean prosecutors indicted a photographer and freedom-of-speech activist last week on charges of violating national security law, for retweeting messages posted by an official North Korean government Twitter account.
Despite the international media's widespread coverage, the case went seriously under-reported in South Korean media.
This case has sparked another round of debate on the controversial national security law, which prohibits "acts benefiting the enemy" without specifying what constitutes such acts.
Controversial tweets
Park Jung-geun, 23, was detained last month, but the incident actually goes back to September 2010, when police raided his photo studio in Seoul.
According to one news report , Park, from 2010 March to January 2011, with his two Twitter accounts (@seouldecadence, @dprkdecadence), retweeted about 102 messages originally tweeted by North Korean Twitter account @uriminzok.
He also tweeted 30 links that led to North Korean video content.
Twitter profile image of user @windburial, the user switched to this image created by Park in order to show his support to Park.
The overall number of Park's "problematic" tweets is 384, which is only about 0.5 per cent of his entire tweets.
In his trial, these tweets were depicted as "an expression of an agreement with the enemy's (referring to North Korea) propaganda" and were accused of "promoting the enemy's messages".
Park claimed his retweets were a joke made to lampoon the North Korean regime and explained that the misunderstanding rose from reading his tweets out of context.
For instance, Park tweeted a tweaked image of a North Korean poster (see right).
Using a typically North Korean poster, which are usually aggressive, warmongering and whose major color is red, Park replaced the soldier's face with his own face and the rifle with a bottle of whisky.
In another example, Park compared himself to North Korea's new heir, Kim Jong-un, since like Kim, he had 'inherited' something from his father, which in Park's case is a photo studio.
South Korean media silence
What has baffled South Koreans however, is that although the police raided Park's studio last year and there has been quite strong opposition against the case online (including the creation of Internet photo memes of Park), recent updates have mostly come from the international media.
Until local media reported about this unusual flow of information, Park's indictment was fairly new to the South Korean general public.

Caribbean: Looking Back on 2011 · Global Voices
The regional blogosphere in 2011 saw a few territories, most notably Cuba, taking front and centre - especially when it came to digital activism.
The rest of the Caribbean meanwhile, grappled with everything from homophobia to states of emergency, weathered hurricanes and questioned the boundaries of online privacy, discussed a plane crash and World AIDS Day and became ardent fans of Project Runway.
Here's a quick look at what our Spanish Language Editor, Firuzeh Shokooh Valle and I agreed was noteworthy this year...
Haiti - Earthquake recovery, Aristide & elections
As physically and economically ravaged Haiti struggled to find its bearings a year after the January 12, 2010 earthquake, Twitter was full of tweets bearing the hashtags #remember #Haiti as netizens recalled the devastation and spared a thought for earthquake victims and survivors alike.
The country was soon to face another strange reality in the form of ousted dictator Jean Claude Duvalier's curiously timed return to his homeland.
There was soon talk of an impending arrest for acts of corruption during his tenure, but although charges were filed, the case soon appeared to fall by the wayside, reportedly because the statute of limitations had expired.

A couple of months later, the country's elections took centre stage, with reports of election threats and subsequent violence.
As it turned out, the candidate accused of leveling those threats, Michel Martelly, popularly known by the moniker "Sweet Micky", went on to claim victory in the polls.
Throughout the earthquake and election turmoil, frustration continued to mount against the United Nations presence in Haiti (MINUSTAH), partly as a result of its troops being responsible for an outbreak of cholera that killed thousands of Haitians, and partly for their crimes against the Haitian people.
Cuba - Deaths of dissident and Las Damas leader and reforms
The (albeit measured) jubilation over the release of Cuban political prisoners in 2010 soon turned to sadness following the death of opposition member Juan Wilfredo Soto Garcia.
Local dissidents insisted that he had been beaten by police, while the government maintained that Soto's “acute pancreatitis…led to multiple organ failure”, even calling the allegations of police brutality a “'smear campaign' aimed at weakening the Cuban revolution.”
The incident called into question modus operandi of the Cuban government, especially considering its routine crackdowns on Las Damas de Blanco, one of the most respected opposition movements on the island, whose members comprise the wives of prisoners of conscience.
The Ladies in White were soon thrust into the spotlight again - this time because of the hospitalization of the group's vibrant leader, Laura Pollan, who subsequently passed away.
The official cause of death was an unidentified infection that reportedly turned out to be dengue fever, but some camps suggested that her treatment may have been sub-standard because of her political stance.
Even as tributes poured in for the late human rights activist, bloggers expressed concern for the safety of other Cuban dissidents, given the climate of apparent state-sanctioned aggression against them. #TwitHab 2011.

One of the high points in the Cuban blogosphere this year was the first meeting of users of the social network Twitter #TwitHab, held last July in Havana at 23rd and 12th of the Vedado district and in the Pabellón Cuba.
The event hosted almost 100 people, mostly young journalism students, administrators, professors, journalists and bloggers, among others.
The event was not free of controversy; nevertheless, Twitter has evidently served as an interesting venue for expression, debate and solidarity.
The sixth congress of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC), held in Havana from April 16-19, marked a turning point for the Cuban economic system, and for Cuban society at large.
Party members approved measures to institute term limits for top party and government leaders, legalize home ownership and sales, and restructure state salaries so that they will be determined in part by the amount and quality of labor performed by workers.
Dominican Republic - Drugs, hurricanes and gold medals
Last November, the Partido de la Liberación Dominicana (PLD-Dominican Liberation Party) nominated Margarita Cedeño, the wife of current president Leonel Fernández, to run for vice-president in the next elections.
The drug connection between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico has also made headlines this year: September saw was the sentencing of the infamous Figueroa Acosta case , considered one of the most scandalous cases of drug trafficking in both these islands.
At the start of the hurricane season, Hurricane Irene devastated the north coast of Dominican Republic leaving approximately 30,000 affected and 11,000 people displaced. (The storm also affected the Bahamas).
Finally, it was a great year in sports: the Dominican Republic achieved a historical record of medals in the past edition of the Pan-American Games held in Guadalajara, Mexico, with seven gold, nine silver, and 17 bronze medals in 26 events.
Trinidad and Tobago - State of emergency
In August, many netizens were taken aback at the unexpected declaration of a state of emergency, ostensibly to deal with the country's rising crime rate.
Nicholas Laughlin summed up the general feeling by pointing out that "this legal step, which affects a broad range of civil rights, has triggered widespread debate about the roots of violent crime in Trinidad and Tobago and the implications of the government's latest strategy."
The government's gaffes resulted in confusion and mounting frustration; bloggers vented online here and here.
When the state of emergency finally came to an end and as expected, violent crime rebounded, the citizenry was left wondering what it achieved, if anything at all.
Puerto Rico - Domestic violence and crime, the arts and sports
The year 2011 was the most violent in the Island’s history with 1,136 murders as of early in the day December 31 , a 15% increase from 2010.
Twenty-six women were murdered (eight cases are still under investigation) by their partners or ex-partners, one of the highest rates in years.
The feminist movement and a group of active feminist bloggers have been at the forefront, denouncing the state’s lack of action against domestic violence.
The United States Justice Department also accused the Puerto Rico Police Department of a pattern of civil rights violations and illegal practices.
On the other hand, it was a wonderful year for the arts and sports.
The Puerto Rican hip hop duo Calle 13 achieved a record in the most recent Latin Grammy Awards where they won nine awards for their most recent album “Entren los que quieran” for a record of a total of 19 Latin Grammys in their career.
Their beautiful song “Latinoamérica” has already become a kind of an anthem for Latin Americans all over the world.
In sports, the Puerto Rican professional basketball player José Juan Barea became one of the most beloved national icons after winning the 2011 US National Basketball Association’s (NBA) Championship playing for the Mavericks team from Dallas, Texas (check this short video on Barea’s life).
Farewells
Finally, Caribbean bloggers were eloquent in their farewells to some luminary people, both home-grown and international.
Trinidad and Tobago lost an environmental champion with the passing of Professor Julian Kenny, as well as an important cultural icon with the death of Dr. Pat Bishop.
Remembrances also poured in as tech-minded bloggers learned of the death of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and wrote about how his visionary products helped to transform their work and their lives.
The human rights activist Sonia Pierre died on December 4.
She was 48. Pierre dedicated her life to advocate for the rights of Haitians living in the Dominican Republic and of Dominicans of Haitian origin.
Pierre was the founder of MUDHA — Movimiento De Mujeres Dominico-Haitiana or Movement of Dominican Haitian Women.
She is remembered as a courageous activist who fought against racism and sexism all her life.
More to look forward to
We have no doubt that in 2012, Caribbean bloggers will have a lot more to talk about - the outcome of Jamaica's recently-held general elections is just one topic that comes to mind - and we look forward to following the regional blogosphere as we continue to strive to facilitate a meaningful exchange of ideas.

Philippines: Protest Against Removal of Trees by Shopping Mall · Global Voices
The plan of SM City Baguio shopping mall in north Philippines to remove more than 100 trees to make way for a new parking lot and entertainment site has been greeted by massive protests from concerned citizens and various cause-oriented groups.
SM is owned by the Philippines' richest businessman.
Thousands marched through the streets of Baguio City last January 20, to defend the trees and call on the public to boycott SM City Baguio.
The hashtag #ProtectBaguiotrees became the top Twitter trend in the country that day.
Take Me to the Riot makes the Joni Mitchel song refrain "They paved paradise to put up a parking lot" the starting point of her musings on the issue:
Funnily, it feels like the entire history of that mountain is all about uprooting and displacement.
Tribes – like the Kankanaey, Igorots, and Ifugao - were uprooted from the heart of the city and were displaced to other places.
Some had to move to other areas in Benguet.
These people, like those trees, have been around older than any SM Baguio, 7-11 or McDonald’s in Session rd.
But commercialism, in this case parking lots, are always stronger–enough to uproot and displace those who have known the land longer and maybe even more intimately.

A Mommy Who Tries Living Life to the Fullest!, inspired by the pro-environment Wall-E 3D animation, points out the lack of significant difference between uprooting and transferring the trees and cutting them down.
These promises are good if you don't know what happened to the past trees that were being earth balled.
Dr. Michael Bengwayan (executive director of Cordillera Ecological Center-PINE TREE) said that, for the 497 pine trees that were being earth-balled by Camp John Hay Development Corp. last 1994, only less than 20% survived and those not dead were showing signs of deteriorating.
So, we should expect that out of the 187 Pine Trees that will be uprooted, more or less only 30 trees will survive.
Baguio City residents decry the lack of public consultations and are questioning the issuance of permit to the mall for the removal of the trees.
Student writers hit the government's connivance with big business:
Worse, even the current administration sanctions this one-sided step and seems to refuse in protecting the interests of the larger population.
President Aquino along with city officials themselves shows no disapproval of this plan and the DENR issued the permit for the implementation.
Stretching the Symbolic meanwhile concludes that the cause is ultimately against the "world capitalist system":
This is not just a battle for the trees, or against SM corporations and their corporate greed; this is a battle for our people, of Baguio and the country, against the large system where tree-cutting projects like this are just one of the numerous evil manifestations.
This is fight against a system where things are done for the benefit of a few and at the expense of the many.
Global: Vigils in Solidarity with Tibetans · Global Voices
Since early February 2012, a series of global vigils have taken place in all over the world to express solidarity with Tibetans, following a call from Kalong Tripa Dr. Lobsang Sangay.
As February 22 is the Tibetan New Year, activists are calling for another round of solidarity action.
A map on global vigils in solidarity with Tibetans on February 8, 2012.
Ever since the invasion of Tibet, the Chinese government has claimed that it seeks to create a socialist paradise.
However, basic human rights are being denied to Tibetans, the fragile environment is being destroyed, Tibetan language and culture is being assimilated, portraits of His Holiness the Dalai Lama are banned, and Tibetans are being economically marginalized.
Tibet is in virtual lockdown.
Foreigners have been barred from travelling to Tibet now and the entire region is essentially under undeclared martial law.
I urge the Chinese leadership to heed the cries of the Tibetan protestors and those who have committed self-immolation.
You will never address the genuine grievances of Tibetans and restore stability in Tibet through violence and killing.
The only way to resolve the Tibet issue and bring about lasting peace is by respecting the rights of the Tibetan people and through dialogue.
As someone deeply committed to peaceful dialogue, the use of violence against Tibetans is unacceptable and must be strongly condemned by all people in China and around the world.
I call on the international community to show solidarity and to raise your voices in support of the fundamental rights of the Tibetan people at this critical time.
I request that the international community and the United Nations send a fact-finding delegation to Tibet and that the world media be given access to the region as well.
The leaders in Beijing must know that killing its own "family members" is in clear violation of international and Chinese laws, and such actions will cast further doubts on China's moral legitimacy and their standing in world affairs.
During Chinese Vice President Xi Jingping's visit to the United States last week, Tibetan activists greeted Xi and the group of organized supporters with stories about human rights conditions in China.
Below is a YouTube video taken on February 15 in Muscatine, Iowa:
As the Tibetan New Year is approaching, a number of Hong Kong activists have organized a candle night vigil outside the China Government Liaison Office to mourn for those Tibetans who have self-immolated to call for a free Tibet.
In addition, more than 240 have signed up for a Butter Lamp Pray event* to express their solidarity with Tibetans:
In Tibet, from 27 Feb 2009 to 19 Feb 2012, 23 Tibetans have self-immolated to protest for a free Tibet and the return of The Dalai Lama. 15 of them had lost their lives.
Under the repressive circumstance in Tibet, self-immolation is an ultimate act of nonviolence demonstration.
Tibet question seems so far away from us, but as a human being, it doesn’t mean that we can do nothing. At least, we should pray for the death.
One of the spiritual practices among Tibetan Buddhists is to offer a lighted butter lamp that represents the illumination of wisdom and to purify bad Karma.
Following their belief, we shall also light for the Tibetans who have self-immolated and pray for Tibet.

Greece: "I Signed the IMF Memorandum Without Having Read It" · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Europe in Crisis.
Shock and awe awaited Greek citizens on Monday January 23, 2012, when Louka Katseli, former minister of labour and social security (2010) and minister of economy, competitiveness and shipping (2009), revealed that she had had only three hours to read the IMF memorandum tackling the country's debt crisis.
Michalis Chrysochoidis, current minister for development, competitiveness and shipping and former minister of citizen protection, admitted on a morning television show interview that he signed the IMF memorandum without having read it at all, arguing that "simply, he had other obligations during that time, as he was fighting against crime":

News spread quickly on the web reacting to the remarks, including extremely negative comments and derogatory insults from netizens, expressing their disdain for the political system, and mocking the minister's excuse.
Within one to two hours, the case became a world trending topic via the Twitter hashtag #de_diavasa_to_mnimonio_giati (I didn't read the memorandum because...):
@northaura: Now whole twitter "parties" with the "I didn't read the Memorandum" statement of Min. Crysochoidis, in hashtag #De_diavasa_to_mnimonio_giati
Global Voices Author and Editor Asteris Masouras (@asteris) made a Storify collection of various posts, photos and tweets.
Below listed are some samples of Greek netizens' tweets and comments:
@ngeor: #De_diavasa_to_mnimonio_giati I was elected to lead, not to read. @Stathisgr: Mnimonio? LoL, Too busy beating protesters
I want to clarify and confirm my point.
Yes, I repeat that I didn't read the memorandum.
I didn't deal with either the text or the procedures of "supposedly" negotiations.
This wasn't declared with pride.
Even more, I don;t say this in order to shirk responsibilities.
On the contrary.
I consider this as one of the biggest errors of my political career; because I appreciated wrongly those critical moments and I was preoccupied with the minor issue, my work as a minister, instead of the major one, my responsibility as a member of the country's leadership.
I said that to stress how much everyone has to change.
We used to trust every leader, every prime minister; to vote in the Parliament and to agree in the government.
Those times belong to the past and this model faded.
What is needed is collectivity, personal responsibility and contribution.
During last year, the government and members of parliament have been the target of heavy criticism for their acceptance of the IMF memorandum and their inaction against the socio-economic crisis of the country, which has urged many of them to defend their beliefs and political actions.
Another "disclaimer statement" was made on October 2011 by former PASOK MP Thomas Rompopoulos, who argued during a radio show broadcast: "Nobody had the time to read the Memorandum, neither I did nor anybody did; We authorized Papakonstantinou to sign for it.
It was a matter of trust":
In addition to the bold accusations Minister Chrysochoidis himself received, many netizens via social media have also criticized the general political scene, but also the "blindness" of they themselves, who have been conniving with the politicians' foul actions:

Italy: Historic 'Guilty' Verdict in the Eternit Asbestos Trial · Global Voices
A historic verdict has been delivered in Italy in the Eternit trial on the deadly consequences of asbestos.
The bosses of multinational Eternit had put the lives of their workers in danger and committed environmental crimes.
However, many people doubted that they would be convicted for their crimes. Yet this is what happened on February 13, 2012 in Turin, northern Italy.
The two top senior executives of Eternit were sentenced to 16 years in prison; legal proceedings began in 2009.
The judges indicted Stephan Schmidheiny, former owner of Eternit, and Louis de Cartier de Marchienne, former director of the Italian branch, as responsible for around 3,000 asbestos-related deaths, particularly in Casale Monferrato and its surrounding areas.
They are also granted compensation to the victims, their families and civil society associations, and tens of millions of euros to some 6,000 plaintiffs.
The sentence was welcomed by hundreds of relatives and victims of asbestos poisoning, as well as by the representatives of the victims’ foreign associations.

The website Swissinfo gives some additional details on the verdict :
Also, public prosecutors in other countries may study the Turin trial as a precedent for bringing their own criminal trials against directors of national Eternit subsidiaries.
According to experts, the product will continue to kill for a long time to come.
The website Sanita in Cifre shows the extent of this risk in Europe and also in the rest of the world:
The President of Naples Province, Luigi Cesaro, listed the death bulletin from the Bagnoli factory:
134 deaths from lung cancer 9 deaths from larynx cancer 258 deaths from asbestosis 65 deaths from mesothelioma
as well as 100 workers still ill from the above illnesses.

Italy: New Volunia Search Engine Intrigues Blogosphere · Global Voices
Volunia is a brand new search engine which encourages interaction between people searching for the same topics in different languages.
Although news of its creation was made public just a few days ago, on Monday 6 February, 2012, Volunia has already caused a stir in the blogosphere, ranging from enthusiasm to disappointment in many languages.
The new search engine tool was created by an Italian professor of Computer Science.
Jean-Marie of website presse-citron.net seemed amazed not only that the project had seen the light of day, but also that it had originated within a university:
Deriving from the Italian words volo (flying) and luna (moon), Volunia is the fruitful result of three years of hard work put in by Marchiori.
On the blog abondance.com Olivier Andrieu gave his opinion following a performance review of this new search engine:
To me, everything from Volunia so far seems to suggest it’s trying to solve a problem that nobody needs to solve right now.
I can’t wait to see it open up and find out whether I’m right or wrong.
This opinion was also shared by Jian who posted this comment after the article:
I am a power user too and tried it.
You said well, it does look like it is trying to solve a problem that doesn’t exist yet.
But anyway, I hope it could make an impact, since we don’t want to have just a Google to take over the whole market…
Another reader of this article, Nebil Kriedi, not sharing this opinion, responded:
A problem which doesn’t exists?
Do you really think that searching for something on the web ends up on showing a dozen of links like most search engine does?
I personally think that your search ends when you find the CONTENT you’re looking for, not just a stupid and chaotic html.
For what I saw, volunia seems to be be designed for that kind of search, a search which brings you straight on the content by following your navigation inside the website.
The idea behind its design (awful) it’s brilliant to me and I hope the execution would be fine too.
A user named Liz left the following comment:
I like the idea of a way to interact with other visitors on a page.
Question is how would it be monitored for security and safety reasons?
I’m always curious who will rival G. The bigger you are the harder you fall… eventually…
After analysing the various aspects of this new search engine, online services specialist Paola Bonomo highlighted the new features which set it apart from other search engines.
She did not seem terribly impressed in her review on her blog pandemia.info:
Volunia adds new concepts and ideas about the web, also it adds the "Social" concept to the search engine.
Also Google is doing it, with its +1 and G+ but I prefer the Volunia way, it feels closest to real life.

Maldives: On the Brink of Chaos · Global Voices
Three years after the first democratic multiparty election in the Maldives ushered a democratic government to power, the infant democracy of the Maldives seems to be on the brink of anarchy and chaos.
The democratic experiment of the Maldives could face an untimely demise as thugs belonging to the ruling party and the opposition clash on the streets of the capital Male', vandalising private property, torching private TV stations and attacking one another under showers of bricks and stones.
A rebellion within the ranks of police officers has created a nasty stand-off between the military and the police and a number of military personnel have joined the police in mutiny.
Tension has reached a tipping point when there are conflicting reports about whether the president will resign.
The political crisis facing the Maldives was given a head-start in January when the government asked the police to start investigations against certain opposition leaders for what the government claimed were baseless insinuations and allegations that the government was undermining the Islamic faith of the country.
Critics were puzzled when the police detained said opposition leaders in high profile investigation cases while the claims of the opposition could have been addressed through a civil case of defamation.
The ruling Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) then started a public campaign named 'Thiheneh Nukiyeyne' (You Can't Say That), proclaiming that the party would not permit the opposition to continue making what it believed to be baseless allegations.
In the past, defamation was a criminal act and writers and individuals were sentenced to prison, based on defamation charges, for criticism they had expressed.
Decriminalizing defamation in 2009 was hailed as a remarkable improvement for freedom of expression in the Maldives.
The government's inclination towards criminal investigations regarding cases of defamation has become a deep concern for advocates of free speech.
After the Abdulla Mohamed, the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court ruled that the detention of the Vice President of the Dhivehi Qaumee Party (DQP) was illegal and ordered to release him from police custody, the police requested the assistance of the Maldives National Defence Force or the military to apprehend the judge.
Mohamed has been under military custody since January 16 and his enforced disappearance has sparked street protests which has continued for three weeks.
Mohamed himself had been in the centre of several controversies earlier and the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) has found that he had violated the code of conduct for judges.
Mohamed appealed this decision of the JSC in the Civil Court, and the court has issued an injunction against JSC not to take any disciplinary measures against Mohamed till the appeal case is closed.
This injunction by the Civil Court itself is highly controversial because it encroaches on the powers the constitution has granted to JSC to make the judiciary accountable.
The government has since then claimed that the detention of Mohamed is part of its campaign to clean up the judiciary, which is corrupt to the core, according to the government.
Mohamed's detention in a military training camp has been declared unlawful and a violation of the constitution by several parties which point out that the military does not have legal authority to detain people.
The government has not put any formal charges against Mohamed.
The military claims that it has provided Mohamed with access to a lawyer and it has permitted the Human Rights Commission of the Maldives to visit him.
His family was informed about his whereabouts only days after he was detained.
A number of eminent lawyers in the Maldives have spoken out against the detention of Judge Abdulla Mohamed.
Among them are Shaheen Hameed, the Vice President of the Constituent Assembly which drafted the current constitution, Dhiyana Saeed, the first Attorney-General of the present government and Husnu Suood, another former Attorney-General under the present government.
Prosecutor-General Ahmed Muizzu, who was a prominent practicing lawyer of the country before his appointment as PG, has also pointed out that the detention is unlawful.
Ahmed Faiz, the Chief Justice, has called for the judge to be released.
The Human Rights Commission of the Maldives has also expressed concerns about the continued detention of the judge. The UN has urged the government of the Maldives to either release the judge or to press formal charges against him.
Abbas Faiz, South Asia Researcher at Amnesty International, in an opinion piece published in the local Minivan News website, has said that the judge's detention is arbitrary.
“Amnesty International is calling on the government to either bring formal criminal charges against him or release him,” Faiz wrote.
Tension has reached a tipping point when protesters from the ruling party and the opposition parties clashed on February 6 evening leading to considerable violence.
Thereafter, some police units stormed the assembly hall of the ruling party and allegedly vandalised property there.
A group of police officers have rebelled against what they say are unlawful commands and gathered after midnight at the Republic Square in Male' in protest.
In a night filled with violence, the offices of VTV, a private broadcaster which is sympathetic towards the opposition and is owned by an opposition leader, was set on fire by a group of thugs.
Aminath Shifleen, a journalist at Haveeru Daily, was injured while covering the protest.
In the past few weeks, a number of journalists have been attacked during the protests and offices of media outlets have been attacked on multiple occasions.
Private property destruction has also been a common feature of the protests that has engulfed the Maldives.
In the early hours of the morning some people are still active on social media, expressing their opinion on the unfolding crisis.
This Facebook page titled Zuvaanunge' Maidhaan (The Square of Youth) has some pictures of the protests.
There are frequent updates in Twitter:
Husnu Suood, former Attorney-General, tweets:
@hsuood: dont think they can avoid a bloody confrontation.

Mexico: Citizen Initiative to the Clear the Streets of Election Trash · Global Voices
Every three years, the streets of Mexico are plastered with a thick layer of unending advertisements sporting images of smiling candidates for a variety of elected positions, each promoting his/her image, name and recycled campaign slogans.
The elections are held, the campaigns draw to a close, and yet the advertisements remain for days, weeks and even months - forming part of the urban landscape.
This year, when the pre-election period in the Federal District (DF) ended and citizens began to pressure Mayor Marcelo Ebrard to immediately remove the trash, he responded:
Uganda has again re-tabled the controversial anti-gay bill.
Ugandan member of parliament, David Bahati, who proposed the bill back in 2009 has again considered tabling the draconian bill but with changes.
He claims to have dropped the death penalty and jailing of family members who fail to report homosexuals to the authorities.
RedPepper reported :
Ndorwa West Member of Parliament David Nahati behind the proposed draconian anti-gay bill that sparked an international outcry has said he wants to drop clauses that would see the death penalty introduced for homosexual acts.
“There will be no death penalty at all…that will go,” Bahati said.
Bahati said he wanted to scrap proposals to punish “aggravated homosexuality,” which includes someone deemed to be a “serial offender” with the death sentence.
The report continued:
However Bahati said the proposed legislation was already in the process of being changed, following recommendations made during the last parliament.
“The death penalty is not part of the process that we are talking about,” Bahati said, adding he was also dropping proposals to jail family members if they failed to report gay relatives to the authorities.
However, Warren Throckmorton noted that the death penalty has not been removed from the bill:
As an aside, the BBC just can’t seem to get their reporting right.
They again are reporting that the death penalty has been removed from the bill.
Yesterday, Parliament spokeswoman Helen Kadaga told me that the bill was the same as was introduced in 2009.
Bahati has said he would be open to removing the death penalty but this has never been done.
In a 2011 report done by the Legal and Parliamentary Affairs committee, the death penalty remained in the bill.
This morning I got additional confirmation that the original bill without amendments was introduced yesterday from Charles Tuhaise, Parliamentary Research Service staffer.
Tuhaise said that all proposed changes to a Bill are first brought to the floor of Parliament where they are debated by the MPs.
Any revisions are accepted to a bill after a majority votes in support of the revision.
For now, the original bill is with the Legal and Parliamentary Affairs committee without amendment.
Melanie Nathan blogged:
Reports are divided as to whether the Bill will include the death penalty as initially tabled.
Many believe the Bill cannot pass in its current form, as it is too onerous and controversial, yet members of Parliament remain defiantly homophobic and either way the future for LGBT people in Uganda is clearly in danger.
Ugandans in Parliament who remain defiant and determined to pass the legislation, do not seem to care at this point whether or not the death penalty is finally excluded as they express homophobia and ignorance in no uncertain terms
In May last year, Warren discussed section 3 of the bill, which deals with the death penalty:
For now, I am going to focus on section three of the report which is where the death penalty can be found.
Here is section 3 from the bill:
Aggravated homosexuality.
(1) A person commits the offense of aggravated homosexuality where the
(a) person against whom the offence is committed is below the age of 18 years;
(b) offender is a person living with HIV;
(c) offender is a parent or guardian of the person against whom the offence is committed;
(d) offender is a person in authority over the person against whom the offence is committed;
(e) victim of the offence is a person with disability;
(f) offender is a serial offender, or
(g) offender applies, administers or causes to be used by any man or woman any drug, matter or thing with intent to stupefy overpower him or her so as to there by enable any person to have unlawful carnal connection with any person of the same sex,
(2) A person who commits the offence of aggravated homosexuality shall be liable on conviction to suffer death.
(3) Where a person is charged with the offence under this section, that person shall undergo a medical examination to ascertain his or her HIV status.
Call Me Kuchu is a documentary that focuses on gay rights in Uganda.
Image source: Call Me Kuchu Facebook page.
The bill has ridiculous clauses such as revoking registration of NGOs promoting or distributing homosexual materials and jailing the director, jailing persons who say they are married to a person of the same sex and prohibiting Uganda from becoming a party to any new international instruments that expressly include protection for homosexual behavior.
Donors threatened to cut aid to Uganda citing that infringing rights and freedom of gays:
Gay sex is illegal in Uganda and MPs supported their colleague to have it banned.
However, human rights activists and the international community protested the Bill saying it was infringing on the rights and freedom of gays.
The donors also threatened to cut their aid to Uganda if such a Bill was passed into law.
The bill does not make sense, said the former South African president Thabo Mbeki:
“I mean what would you want?
It doesn’t make sense at all.
That is what I would say to the MP.
What two consenting adults do is really not the matter of law,” he said.
Mr Mbeki also responded to a series of questions about the failure of Africa’s present day intellectuals to cultivate ideas for progressive movement of change on the continent and the weakness of the African Union in defending and promoting the interests of Africans.

Some churches in Uganda are against the bill:
“I am very disappointed with the return of the bill,” former Anglican Bishop Christopher Ssenyonjo of West Buganda told ENInews in a telephone interview on Feb. 8 from Kampala, Uganda’s capital.
A significant change is the removal of the provision for the death penalty, but the new bill still increases to life imprisonment the punishment for homosexual activity, which is illegal in Uganda, with many faith leaders rejecting it as sinful and contrary to Scripture.
Melanie Nathan interviewed David Bahati:
I asked about the death penalty and he told me that the Bill will be first introduced in its original form.
What happens after that, he said, “would please you people as it would be more moderate.”
Yet he could not confirm what would be changed.
He told me that the most important thing is that once the Bill passes there can be no more “promotion of that behavior” in Uganda.
That the government will clamp down on organizations and NGO’s which promote homosexuality.
He said, “but don’t worry the bill will not be harmful to you people; and it will protect the children of Uganda.
“ We cannot mess up the future of our children.”
He told me that Ugandans will not be blackmailed by the West.
He said that the West is bringing the idea of homosexuality to Ugandan and telling Africans what to do about homosexuality and that he said is “Imperialism; we will not be blackmailed by your few dollars.”
I asked Bahati about tourism, “are you concerned people will stop visiting Uganda if you pass the Bill?”
He said, “no Uganda has been voted the best destination in Africa last year.
I am not worried about that.”
He told me that the purpose of the Anti-homosexuality Bill is to “protect our children from promotion of that behavior.”
I then asked what about consenting adult in private.
He said that is outlawed “because they are doing the wrong thing.”
Mark Widdicombe pointed out that the bill is based on a false premise:
Apart from the barbarity of penalties envisioned, the entire Bill is based on a false premise.
The first paragraph of the Bill states:
This legislation further recognizes the fact that same sex attraction is not an innate and immutable characteristic.
But same sex attraction has been shown in numerous peer-reviewed research papers to be precisely an innate and immutable characteristic. Here are some examples.
But even if homosexuality were a choice and not an immutable characteristic, it would still not be excusable to pass legislation of this sort which seeks to criminalise consensual sexual behaviour between adults.
It seems reasonable to ask why Mr Bahati has such an antipathy to those who prefer the caresses of their own sex.
He says it’s because homosexuality was introduced to Africa by the colonial powers, and he wants it eradicated and Africa’s traditional strong family values reasserted.
An examination of African folklore, as, for example, embodied in Indaba, My Children by Credo Mutwa gives the lie to that assertion.
Homosexuality was known millennia before the arrival of European colonists, and was well tolerated.
As part of a global campaign to support gay rights in Uganda, a documentary called Call Me Kuchu has been released:
Filmed over the course of two years during three visits to Uganda starting January 2010, Call Me Kuchu is a documentary that focuses on gay rights (to be precise – the absence of them) in the “Pearl of Africa”.
Co-directed by video journalist Malika Zouhali-Worrall and award-winning photographer Katherine Fairfax Wright, the film premiered yesterday, 11th February in the 62ndinternational Berlin Film Festival Panorama Documentary programme.
This film follows the life of David Katos, Uganda’s first openly gay activist, and his pledge against the Anti-Homosexuality Bill that religious groups in Uganda were trying to pass in 2011.
Devoid of one of the basic human rights – the right to openly love whoever they wish, and not be afraid of getting killed on the street or be imprisoned for 7 years because of that, as the Bill would allow – David and three fellow activists (“kuchus”, as homosexuals are called in Uganda) share their painful life stories and day-to-day encouragements.
They believe the situation can one day be changed, if they only keep fighting and take pride in who they are.
At the same time one of the most popular Uganda’s tabloids, Rolling Stone, keeps printing hateful articles that disclose gays who did not wish to come out of the closet under the current situation, and openly encourages violent acts against them.
Human rights activists have created an online petition, Stop The Kill The Gays Bill, as part of their campaign to stop the bill.
Here is the full text of the Anti-Homosexuality Bill 2009.
Africa: Vote for the Most Influential African Thinker Alive · Global Voices
Who is the most influential African thinker alive?
Africa is a Country blog wants readers to vote for one influential African thinker from a list of 12 candidates. Sean Jacobs writes about the origin of the idea:
I got the initial idea from the British blog, Left Foot Forward, which had run a contest to determine “the most influential leftwing thinker of the year 2010/11.” He explains how they came up with the list of candidates:
So here we are.
To start things of, we came up with a list of candidates we canvassed internally.
Not everyone will be happy with the list, but we tried thinking of a range of intellectuals representing different parts of the continent, not just from one country.
As South African writer Zakes Mda recently tweeted: “Zimbabwe compares only with Nigeria in the per capita production of African intellectuals (scholars, writers, scientists, economists etc.)”
In fact, an earlier draft of the List was heavily South African and Egyptian.
(That draft was not supposed to be up and one reader responded in kind.
It’s been corrected.)
We confess this list is subjective and that is why we have a second round where your suggestions will make up the choices.
Others wanted to know why we’re not including people on twitter: Our response is that we are not sure 140 characters make you “an intellectual.”
A lot of stuff on twitter, including our own tweets, is half-baked and amounts to what Americans call “carnival barking” (in the service of traffic or attracting followers), so it is better to leave that alone.
African thinkers.

The polls will be open until 5 March, 2012:
Once polls close, we will arrive at a shortlist of five.
Then it gets interesting: We will have a second, separate round of voting based on your recommendations.
That is while you vote in round one, we’ll compile a list of ten names from your suggestions in the comment section, on our facebook page and on Twitter.
Candidates who are already on the first list, won’t be included on the second.
A second vote/poll will proceed and we’ll announce the result.
We will then combine the top five vote takers from the second list with the top five vote takers from the first list.
There will then be a third and final round of voting based on the new combined list that will take one week. After that we will announce the overall winner.
The candidates are: Samir Amin, academic, activist (Senegal/Egypt), Jean and John Comaroff, academics (South Africa/United States), Chinua Achebe, writer (Nigeria), Mahmood Mamdani, academic (Uganda), Mamdouh Habashi, academic, politician (Egypt), Kwame Anthony Appiah, academic, philosopher (Ghana/United States), Achille Mbembe, academic (Cameroon/South Africa), J M Coetzee, writer (South Africa/Australia), Issa Shivji, academic (Tanzania), Nawal el Saadawi, writer and activist (Egypt), Wole Soyinka, writer, activist (Nigeria) and Virginie Toure, activist (Cote d'Ivoire).
Africa is a Country is a group blog:
This post is part of our special coverage Forest Focus: Amazon Nilcilene Miguel de Lima, a small rural producer and local leader from the Amazon region, is under protection of the National Force as she has been receiving constant death threats by land-grabbers and illegal loggers.
In the beginning of February, the Brazilian investigative news agency A Pública went to the town of Lábrea, in the federal state of Amazonia, to interview her:
Why do we have to live like that?
Someone has to fight, to do something.
The authorities have to take action.
So many conflicts because of logging and land.
If the National Force leaves, my partner and I have to leave before them.
If we stay, before being killed, we will be tortured.
Until today, I keep receiving death threats.
Shot dead for protecting the forest
As well as being one of six people under 24 hour protection of the National Force, Nicelene is among 172 people who have received death threats by gunmen in the Brazilian countryside. According to the Comissão Pastoral da Terra (CPT) , an organization which supports rural rights to land and water, this figure has increased 107% compared to 2010, when 83 people were in the same situation.
Last year, as Global Voices reported, the CPT published data which shows that 1,614 people have been murdered in the last 25 years due to rural conflicts.
This number includes worldwide known cases as those of Chico Mendes, Dorothy Stang and the Eldorado dos Carajás killing amongst others.
Current information shows that, in total, the number of people coping with pressures imposed by outlaws due to land and water conflicts in Brazil increased from 38.555 in 2010 to 45.595 in 2011.
There were 32 executions of workers or local leaders from these communities in 2010 and 23 in 2011, as CPT reported.

The intervention of the National Force to protect local community leaders in the Northern region of Brazil, came also as a consequence of the work of the CPT.
The CPT handed in to the Special Secretariat for Human Rights , a body within the Brazilian Ministry of Justice, a list with people under death threat after the murder of Maria do Espírito Santo and her husband José Claudio Ribeiro da Silva in the federal state of Pará shamed the country.
After the brutal murder of the couple, other killings have hit the headlines as those of Adelino Ramos in the federal state of Rondônia and of Nísion Gomes, an indigenous chief, in the Central-Eastern state of Mato Grosso do Sul.
CPT asserts that:
There are people who keep saying it not worthy it.
To me it is worth it.
To me, to my husband it is definitely worth it.
I know there's a risk, I have no doubt about that.
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't afraid.
Another two victims have been in the spotlight recently: João Chupel Primo and Junior José Guerra.
The former was shot dead October last year and the latter had to leave his community behind last month with his family.
For the sake of growth and Rio +20
Having new perspectives in the changing international scenario, the Brazilian state has acquired new economic and political capabilities using what is known as 'soft power'.
Like any other nation state, it is under pressure to push its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rates up in order to attract investors to buy its sovereign bonds in the international market.

But, while some praise a “sustainable” economic growth, others consider that President Dilma Rouseff has a misleading perspective of development .
For Assuntos Produtos da Mente the export-oriented production in Brazil "is undergoing a process of reprimarization of the economy based on the production and export of agricultural and non agricultural commodities (mining), which is unable to fund and promote sustainable development and solidarity and meet the needs of the Brazilian people."
One of the most controversial initiatives is the bill to change the current forestry code.
The Brazilian Society for the Advancement of Science (SBPC, in Portuguese) handed in an open letter to the reader of the bill proposed last week in which reads:
Brazil will host Rio+20 and on its territory is located the world’s biggest rain forest.
And part of this forest is dominated by organized crime.
And part of it is stained by the blood of Brazilians who have fought for it without any support of the State and have died for it having said – on video – that they were going to die.
On part of this forest, ipê and other precious woods are being robbed in conservation unities and part of this wood comes out legalized from Brazilian ports towards Europe.
If that’s not a reason for embarrassment when hosting a conference on environment, then the world is even more cynical than I suspected.

Colombia: FARC Announces End to Kidnappings, Release of Hostages · Global Voices
The FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), the largest and oldest guerilla group in Colombia, recently announced on February 26 , 2012, that they would release ten military hostages currently being held captive.
The group had suspended a previously scheduled release of 6 hostages last year after denouncing ongoing military operations.
Through this announcement the FARC reported that they would renounce kidnapping as a financing means and emphasized their desire to stop the war which has been ongoing for 48 years.
This news naturally has set off reactions among several citizen mediums, national and international.
And despite it only being several weeks since their announced desire to end the war, the FARC continues making news for its violence , having an armed protest strike in the department of Choco, where serious problems springing from the conflict have been expressed on Twitter with the hashtag #EL_CHOCÓ_NECESITA_PAZ (Choco needs peace) .
In addition there continue to be reported various confrontations with the armed forces in Cauca and other regions of Colombia.

The website Colombia Soy Yo (I am Colombia), founded in 2008 by a group of civilians whose mission is “Constructing a Colombia without armed outlaw groups, pushing responsible, collective action based on human development,” have promoted campaigns like "Today is Your Day: Second Message Marathon for Reconciliation and Freedom," mentioning the FARC communication and repeat their petition for the liberation of six hostages.

Spain: Head of Journalist Association Threatens Activist With a Belt · Global Voices
The Head of the Press Association in Granada, Antonio Mora, was presenting a photo exhibition in Granada, Spain, of the relations between Israel and Spain on Tuesday, March 6, when anti-occupation activists from an organization called Plataforma Andalucía con Palestina (Platform Andalucia with Palestine) entered the room.
They held Palestinian flags and started chanting "Boycott Israel" and "No to Zionist impositions" in protest against Spain's support of the Israeli occupation of Palestine through these kind of institutional events.
The activists did not leave when Mora told them to keep quiet, visibly impatient and irritated by their presence.
What happened next?
The answer is so surreal that you should see it by yourselves.
Here is the link to the video.
Screenshot of the video in the moment when Antonio Mora holds his belt as he walks towards the activist.
Shockingly, Mora removes his belt and raises it as if to strike one of the women with it, while a second woman records the scene with her mobile phone.
A few seconds later he drops the belt and tries to push the other woman out of the room.
The fact that this reaction comes from the head of a press association has sparked shock and disbelief among Spanish netizens, who have flooded Twitter with comments and even created a hashtag with the Head´s name: #antoniomora.

Spain: Are You For or Against EuroVegas? · Global Voices
Las Vegas in Europe... Do you like the sound of it?
A giant complex that wouldn't pale in comparison with its American counterpart with its six casinos, three golf courses, nine theatres and twelve hotels, not to mention a multitude of restaurants and shops. This is the project being put forward by multibillionaire Sheldon Adelson, CEO of Las Vegas Sands and 14th wealthiest person in the world according to Forbes magazine.
After having conquered America (Nevada and Pennsylvania) as well as Asia (Macao and Singapore), the gambling magnate now contemplates taking over Europe, and more specifically Spain .
The colossal project would create more than 200,000 jobs, attract between 15 and 18.8 billion euros worth of investments up until 2022, and generate more than 15 billion euros from tourism income over ten to fifteen years.
It seems an apparent golden opportunity for a country bogged down in the Euro Crisis, as Spain is one of the PIGS (Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain) , a derogatory term used to refer to these economically fragile states.

United States: "I am Trayvon Martin" · Global Voices
On February 26, 2012, George Zimmerman, a 'Neighborhood Watch Volunteer' in Sanford, Florida, USA, shot and killed 17 year-old Trayvon Martin while the latter was coming out of a store with freshly-purchased candy.
George Zimmerman confessed to the police that he shot Trayvon in the chest.
According to the 911-recording of the telephone conversation published last Friday night, George Zimmerman had notified the police of a "suspicious individual", Trayvon Martin, a 17 year-old black youth, coming out of a store.
The 911-operator stated that George Zimmerman had been told not to pursue the young man.

The indignation of American citizens and internauts regarding the incident continues to grow and is still making front-page headlines in the town of Sanford where the murder took place.
The police unit in charge of the case up to now has not been able to come up with any formal charges against George Zimmerman, whose act is considered as a racial crime by many.
Gareth Bryant on his blog, comments:
Why is the Black man always on the endangered-species list?
It’s like it’s my destiny, to forever be victimized in this matrix.
jrcm.t writes:
the perfect combination: "A fire arm and a black man" - racism at its best!!!
And the defence is said to plead "citizens' rights to use fire arms for self-defence.”
The social network reacted with this formula: white man > spanish man > black man.
The racial connotation in this case seems obvious, indeed.
Even though the US Department of Justice and the FBI have initiated an investigation as to the "facts and circumstances" surrounding the murder of Trayvon Martin, the internet community continues to put pressure on the US government to render justice.
Among the more pertinent comments:

Tericruz, in The Huffington Post comment section (which has received thousands of comments on the article since its publication) writes:
You can hear the boy screaming for his life in the back ground of the 911 calls.
I cried because all I could do is think of my son, in that position, knowing he was about to die and no one was there to help him.
God Bless his soul and his family.
Claudial adds:
The law in Florida sounds like it gives cover to anyone who wants to commit murder, provided there are no witnesses.
If I lived in Florida, I would be very afraid.
The gun laws in this country are completely up-side-down.
MrScorpio created a subject on DemocraticUnderground.com and ever since, internauts have been inundating the site with their reactions, personal testimonies and memories of mistreatment by white people in the United States.
On Change.org more than one million people have signed a petition addressed to the US Attorney General, and others, to ensure that justice be served.
Twitter has been flooded with comments about the case.
Photos of demonstrations in Florida are available by following the following hashtag: #Trayvon.
@Black Voices: At city hall, hundreds of residents and activists are calling for the arrest in the Trayvon Martin incident: #trayvon
@YsanneBueno broaches the racial issue:
@MUTHAKNOWS If Trayvon had been a white boy and Zimmerman a black man, I wonder how this all would have panned out? #TrueStory
@OmariShakirXo asks the global community to unite in memory of Trayvon:
Everyone who wanted to arrest Kony, please share your sadness over the Trayvon case.
I really can't see how that would be asking too much...
Many are demonstrating against the "Stand Your Ground" law, in force in Florida since 2005, which widens the auto-defence zones of residential areas to include most public areas as well.
Such a law eliminates the notion under English law whereby one must "retreat" when faced with dangerous situations outside the home.
Without this nuance, an American citizen who is armed now has no obligation to withdraw when faced with a threat.
@Karen Hunter tweeted:
Can someone please explain to me why this "Stand Your Ground" exists?
@Touré added:
The "Stand Your Ground" law does not stipulate that "If you feel threatened by a young black youth, you respond with a shotgun".
Charles M. Blow in the New York Times concludes:
Although we must wait to get the results from all the investigations into Trayvon’s killing, it is clear that it is a tragedy.
If no wrongdoing of any sort is ascribed to the incident, it will be an even greater tragedy.
United States: Another Assault on Immigrant Culture · Global Voices
The decision to eliminate the Mexican-American studies program from public schools curriculum, which had been implemented in Tucson, Arizona, in 1998, has caused outrage.
For many, the dismantling of the program and the confiscation of a great number of books is the living example of the ultra conservative agenda that is threatening the cultural and historic breadth of this region.
The decision approved in January by the Superintendent of Tucson's Independent School District, John Huppethal, is based on ARS-15-112 statute of HB 2281 Law.
As explained by Jasmine Villa in LatinitasMagazine this law forbids courses or classes that:
Are designed primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group. Advocate ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals.

Guatemala: Empowering Communities Through Pedal Powered Machines · Global Voices
Maya Pedal is an organization in Guatemala that specializes in bringing progress through secondhand bicycles.
Those that they can repair, get a new life as inexpensive means of transportation in the streets of Guatemala and those that aren't usable as bicycles anymore get turned into pedal powered machines to help in daily work such as pumping water, grinding corn, blending, shelling nuts and making roof tiles.
Demonstrating the Maize Mill in Atitlan by Maya Pedal
As written about on Central American Politics and the Earth911 website, the Maya Pedal initiative provides needed equipment to communities without the need of electricity or fuels.
The following English subtitled video shows some of the machines and the people behind the project:
From the Maya Pedal website:
Pedal power can be harnessed for countless applications which would otherwise require electricity (which may not be available) or hand power (which is far more effort).
Bicimaquinas are easy and enjoyable to use.
They can be built using locally available materials and can be easily adapted to suit the needs of local people.
They free the user from rising energy costs, can be used anywhere, are easy to maintain, produce no pollution and provide healthy exercise.
We make water pumps, grinders, threshers, tile makers, nut shellers, blenders (for making soaps and shampoos as well as food products), trikes, trailers and more.
Maya Pedal also provides instructions and building plans for some of their most popular designs so that people can build their own "bicimáquinas", what they call their pedal powered bike machines.
You can see some of the machines and work with the communities in this 3 part video series featuring 2003 footage of Maya Pedal: from their process designing equipment according to needs expressed by farmers, to community meetings where their machines are presented and people learn how to use them.
They also teach people how to make and repair the bike machines, a necessity when taking them to remote areas.
Guatemala: Speaking Out on the Genocide of Indigenous Women · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Indigenous Rights.
The 36 year long civil war (1960-1996) that ravaged Guatemala, left more than 200,000 people dead and at least 100,000 women raped: most of the victims were Mayan.
Only recently have women started speaking out about the violence they suffered in hands of the Army and paramilitaries, and finally, thanks to Women's Link World and The Center for Justice and Accountability, the sexual violence perpetrated against Mayan women is being investigated as part of the genocide proceedings taking place in Spanish tribunals.

The documentary The Invisible Genocide of Women, by photojournalists Ofelia de Pablo and Javier Zurita gives us the harsh reality of female survivors who tell disturbing accounts of abuse, torture and violence, and also the efforts to advance with the ongoing forensic and legal investigation in the indictment of former Guatemalan President Efraín Ríos Montt.
The 2008 documentary Women, Violence, Silence by Javier Bauluz brings light to the story of Manuela, a single mother who works in a family integration center in Verapaz, one of the areas most affected by the 36 year civil war that ravaged the country.
It is through Manuela's work that the reality of women's situation in Guatemala comes through the light.
In a country where there is an average of two women murdered daily women are under constant threat: the massive and organized violations they suffered during the conflicts, chauvinist violence, child abuse and discrimination based on gender and race are only some of the most important issues.

India: Don't Work at Night and You Won't Be Raped · Global Voices
In recent days a number of working women have been abducted and raped in the city of Gurgaon, located within 30 kilometres of the Indian capital New Delhi.
But all the administration could do in response is to shrug off its responsibility to provide safety to the citizens, by asking all malls, commercial establishments and pub owners not to have women employees working beyond 8pm at night.
Indian netizens have exploded with rage and disbelief while expressing their reactions.
Some reactions were sarcastic, some were eye opening, and some explaining the absurdity of this call.
Aamjanata thinks that this directive is unreasonable as it is a requirement for many jobs to stay late:
there are supposed to be police women working night shifts too.

Sandip Roy at the First Post is critic about the ploy of the police to ignore the responsibility:
If the police are going to wash their hands off the entire affair, here is an alternative solution that’s getting some buzz on Twitter: how about a curfew on all the men in Gurgaon after 8 pm?
The Life and Times of an Indian Homemaker questions:
Do you as a citizen find the Gurgaon Administration’s response reassuring?
Would it not have been more reassuring if it was made clear that negligence of duty by the police would not be repeated or excused?
The blogger also asks:
Are jobs, safety and roads after 8 pm, in Gurgaon, reserved for men?
Rambling In The City blames the mindset of the patriarch society:
My first reaction, of course, is how easy it is for society (the authorities are reflecting a larger social attitude) to ask women to behave ‘within limits’.
Just like recent incidents in which airline staff asked people with disabilities to deplane, the attitude reeks of a mindset in which women are considered weak, disadvantaged and mostly a problem.

@Ankursays: #Gurgaon was once a proud symbol 4 our country devlopment.
Now the whole #NCR has become a shame symbol ( #rape destination) 4 our country.
@Nadlakha: Just because a couple of men can't control an erection, women have to sit at home.
What an idea! #gurgaon
@saliltripathi: So it seems in Gurgaon rapists have official working hours.
@LadyAparna: RT @Harneetsin: So women in Gurgaon are told to be home by 8pm if they don't wanna be raped.
Rapists in India get their own “official” Happy Hours now.
Die.
@NameFieldmt: So men are like werewolves or something.
They are saints till 8 pm and become barbaric rapists once the clock strikes 8. #Gurgaon
While everyone is talking about the problem and the preventive measure, Ankita Mahajan ponders about a solution:
Government should take austere initiative to blackout such cases.
If a person is found as a criminal and arrested in a rape case, then there should be only one punishment for him- sentence to death.
Iran: "Should We Vote Again?" · Global Voices
The Islamic Republic is preparing for parliamentary (Majlis) election on Friday, March 2, 2012.
It is the first national election since the controversial 2009 presidential election and subsequent mass demonstrations.
While several opposition groups have called for boycotting the election, the Iranian state is employing anti-Western propaganda to bring citizens to the polls.
Setare Iran has published a poster with an image of Neda, a young woman killed during protests, with a slogan that says, "I do not vote."
The blogger says:
Beyond the question of whether taking part in this election is useful or not, how can someone go to the polls after all these martyrs and with thousands of innocents imprisoned?
This election on Friday will not honour our votes.
It is a test for a regime who considers that the intelligence of the people is non-existant.
Neda's innocent gaze does not let us to sell our honour to a dictatorship.
Azarakan says :
Contrary to the regime's propaganda that says Western countries will attack Iran if people do not vote, boycotting the election makes the regime understand it does not have any legitimacy.
It forces them to stop challenging the international community with its nuclear program.
A one minute film recalls that members of parliament backed backed the last fraudulent election, and brought economic misery to the country.
The final message of the video questions, "Should we vote again?"
Of course, not all Iranian bloggers share the same opinion on the election.
Ahestan considers that problems do not get solved by not taking part in the election because the political participation of the people can be a strong answer to enemies ("a fist to their mouth").
"If they encourage people not to vote, then why should the Islamic Republic not encourage them to vote?" he says.
To vote or not to vote, may finally not be the question, since some analysts predict the government will report a turnout of 60 percent or higher, regardless of what happens on Friday.
Jordan: One Year On, Tensions Building Up · Global Voices
It's March 24th, 2012 - a year after the weekend that shocked Jordan domestically, further exacerbating a lethargic reform effort.
It is the anniversary of the weekend when a diverse group of Jordanians took to the streets of Amman with the intent of open peaceful protest and were met with a counter group that called itself 'Home Calling' (Nidaa Watan).
Nidaa Watan chanted in the name of their allegiance to King Abdullah, branded with symbols of patriotism, carrying pictures of the king as their tone and language grew in aggression.
Global Voices curated some reactions from March 24th and March 25th, 2011.
Reflecting on that weekend, Mohanned al-Arabiat wrote last year on the citizen media site 7iber:
I won’t get into their funding and logistical support, but let me just say this: it had government hands all over it.The group set up a page on Facebook.
The rhetoric was extremely fascist, with threats of violence and even a holocaust against the March 24 guys.
Some commentators even quoted Hitler.
The intention to harm was there for all the world to see it.
One has to wonder if the state “saw” it.
In real life.
The scene was ugly, but ONE thing was clear: One side was peaceful, the other side was not (read here).
One side was hurling stones and insults, the other side was not.
Mohanned's observations continued:
Don’t say we are not ready or worthy of liberty and dignity.
It is not about democracy, for democracy is but a tool.
It is about us.
Our humanity.
Our innate dignity and God-given right to liberty.
Hate and violence spewed by groups formed around the wrong values don’t indict the individuals, for individuals are less likely to hurt and be evil when “alone” or when they are detached from the aforementioned groups.
Lets build groups around our rights.
Today, a year later, protests continue, tensions are growing, and Jordan is more fragmented than ever with evident reform talk fatigue.
And on the other end a playing down of these tensions or what seems like a blasé disregard to the need for better listening and to radically change our ways.
New chasms surfacing, and the old deepening.
The Public Security Department (PSD), the Gendarmerie (Darak), and the General Intelligence Department (GID) have successfully managed to prevent mayhem with little confrontation and aggression with the street.
However, I believe that the tense public discourse and ongoing protests echo a political, economic, social and cultural pressure cooker.
The crisis?
A failure to communicate.
Reflecting on March 24 and the year, last night Tayseer Al Kloob blogged (Ar): Where are the Jordanians?
Have they had enough of this dream?
What are these numbers with no voice?
Are people fed up?
Have they forgotten?
Are they satiated?
Has their dream come true?
Where are the thousands of digital heroes from Facebook and Twitter?
I am not provoking, but rather merely asking, as I'm a simple Jordanian and for this nation I hold a dream in my little heart.
This week in Amman, a series of events and debates are planned that aim to take stock of the year and delve into where some civic movements stand, conversations camped on:
- #JoDebate, today evening, March 24, by the Jordan Debate Club on whether the movement that continues to take to the streets is representative of Jordanians.
- #MaqhaAmman, Tuesday March 27th, by Maqha Amman AlSiyasi (Café Politique-Amman) a conversation among participants of last year's Dakhliyeh Circle protests.
- #HashtagDebates, Saturday March 31st, by 7iber.com debating the repercussions of the March 24 protests on the political scene and Jordan's reform movement.
Morocco: Singer's Performance in Tel Aviv Ignites Debate on Israel's Cultural Boycott · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Morocco Protests 2011.
Hindi Zahra is a young Moroccan singer.
A talented self-taught multi-instrumentalist, the artist embraced success soon after the release of her debut album, Handmade, in 2009.
Hailed by the critics as "the worthy successor to Billie Holiday", she received prestigious prizes, the last of which in February 2011, when she won the Victoires de la Musique award for the best world music album.
Her success has led her on tour across the globe.
Her sultry and intimate jazz style, often sung in English, mixing blues songs with Moroccan Berber melodies, has somehow managed to cross cultural barriers, attracting even larger audiences.
At least this was the case until last October, when it was revealed that the singer was scheduled to perform in Tel Aviv, Israel, on November 12, 2011.
A Moroccan woman in Tel Aviv
The Palestinian Campaign for Cultural and Academic Boycott of Israel quickly published an open letter to the singer calling for the cancellation of her concert in Israel.
"We are surprised that you have agreed to provide entertainment to a society that practices occupation, racial discrimination, and ethnic cleansing while our refugees - the majority of our people! - Continue to be deprived from their inalienable right to return to their homes," the letter reads.
To the dismay of the boycott campaigners, the concert was maintained as scheduled.
In an interview with the Moroccan press, Omar Barghouti, one of the founders of the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (or BDS) campaign, describes his disappointment at the decision of the artist to go on with her representation in Israel:
We were disappointed by behavior.
In her reply to us, there was a lot of hate.
An Amazigh artist also tried to convince her, but she reacted very badly.
Chickens come home to roost
On Wednesday, December 14, the musical tour finally brought Hindi Zahra back home in Morocco for a concert in Casablanca, the country's most affluent and populous city.
On the Internet the controversy broke out when a group of activists, believed to be linked to the Moroccan chapter of the BDS Movement, published a call on Facebook asking people to join a sit-in outside the concert venue.
For some reason, the call was removed from Facebook a few hours later.
Blogger Ghali Bensouda published a screenshot (see bellow) of the call:
Screenshot of the sit-in call as published by Ghali Bensouda
Will organize a protest against normalization with Israel and as a reminder that Moroccan people reject any form of normalization with the Zionists
Among netizens the reactions were split between those who supported the protesters, and those who, like Ghali Bensouda, saw in the protest the instrumentalisation by radical political factions of the youth-based February 20 movement, who has been leading the pro-democracy protests in the country for the last 10 odd months.
When Hindi Zahra performed in Israel, it was her right.
When #feb20 protests against her, it's their right too.
Now move on with your lives.
The cultural boycott of Israel has been going on for years. #feb20 is not doing anything controversial.
Arab World: Happy Mother's Day - Tribute to Martyrs' Mothers · Global Voices
The Arab world marks Mother's Day today, on March 21.
On social networking sites, netizens have sent out congratulations to their mothers on the day. They also remember the mothers of the thousands of martyrs killed by the authorities as they protested against dictatorship in this so-called Arab Spring.
From Bahrain, Sayed Ahmed Al Alawi tweets :
في هذا اليوم لطف الله بقلب كل أم فقدت فلدة كبدها مقتولا ظلماأو مغيبا في المعاقلات أو مشردا في الوطن والمهجر لكل هؤلاء الامهات نقول فصبر جميل @SAalalawi: On this day, may God have mercy on the heart of every mother who has lost her child, killed unjustly, or imprisoned or forced into exile.
To all those mother we say: patience is sweet
Egyptian Salma Hegeb shares a similar sentiment. She reminds us:
@Salma_ts2al: It's the second #MothersDay for some mothers of martyrs in Egypt.
Since yesterday and I'm thinking how painful is that...
And Syrian Zain has bad news:
@ZainSyr: The number of martyrs in #Syria has risen to 70, including 14 children and 7 women #MothersDay
The heartbreak many, particularly children and mothers, felt on this day is summed up by Syrian blogger Razan Ghazzawi, who admits:
@RedRazan: I really envy those who have many words to say to the mothers of martyrs on Mother's Day.
I can't even find one word. #Syria #Mothersday
@RedRazan: #Syria Facebookers have been campaigning 2 encourage citizens 2 visit mothers of martyrs 2day,2 show them they're not alone in their plight.

The Facebook Page is called We are Your Children, Martyr's Mother and can be found here .
Back in Egypt, Mohannad tells us : @mand0z: One of the things I respect in my mother is that she is a revolutionary.
Although I know she stays at home terrified when I am out during clashes, she prays for me and supports me
Meanwhile, Syrians abroad are finding it difficult to connect with family back home and wish their loved ones a Happy Mother's Day.
The 47th tweets:
@THE_47th: Seriously, I have to f^^&** find a satellite phone or tie a message to a pigeons feed to tell my grandma Happy Mother's Day in #Homs
Kareem Lailah adds:
@KareemLailah: Please Assad, give me the communication back just for 1 minute to tell her #HappyMothersDay mom! #Syria #iLoveYou
And Syrian Shakeeb Al-Jabri jokes:

Myanmar: Life Inside a Refugee Camp · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage on Refugees. Nine months have passed since clashes broke out between the Myanmar Army and Kachin Independence Organization (KIO).
Thousands of people have fled to refugee camps in other areas in Kachin State, and in villages near China's border.
At least 66 refugees camps have been set-up in government-controlled areas, while others are in Kachin Independence controlled areas and on the China side of the border.
Based in Yangon, Burmese blogger Nang Nyi and her friends visited one of those refugee camps near the China border in mid-February, and she wrote about her experience there.
In part one of her blog entry, she started her story by saying:
As everyone know, I am just a normal girl.
I do not get involve in politics, nor do I understand it, and I don't hold onto or participate in any parties or organizations or any ideology.
I only believe in freedom, justice, and humanitarianism.
So I would like to share back my experience in the way I've seen it and I've felt it.
There were four other friends who went along on the trip with her.
They travelled from Yangon to Mandalay and then to Muse, in Shan State.
They then crossed over to Chinese's border town of Shwe Li to buy the necessary things for the refugees.
The next day, they went to the refugee camp:

When war broke in Kachin State, refugees ran away to the nearest border to escape.
Loizer Refugee Camp is a well-known camp.
But the refugee camps we went to were at the borders near Lwe Je. The camps are in the Chinese area of Lai Yin, next to Lwe Je.
The refugee camps near Lai Yin were managed by a Kachin group called Wunpawng Ninghtoi (WPN).
"Wunpaung" in Kachin means "All Kachins", and "Ninghtoi" means "Light".
So you can say that this group is the "Light of Kachins".
When she entered the refugee camp, she saw many kids, but the kids seemed to be afraid of her:

I have volunteered at orphanages and monastic education centres, so I was used to being delighted at seeing the kids and greeting them enthusiastically.
But here, we can not get near these kids.
We were sad to see that kids ran away from us because we were unfamiliar faces and our looks showed that we were Bamar.
She also commented about the conditions of the refugee camp:
Tents at the Refugee Camp (Photo by Nang Nyi)
One thing we faced when we got there was (not having enough) toilets.
In a refugee camp that had over 1000 people, they only had 11 toilets.
The water for the toilet has to be retrieved from an almost-dry stream over a mile away.
In the whole camp, there was one well. They use that water for drinking.
The camp was built on an old dump site between the sugarcane fields at the outskirts of a Chinese village.There were no big trees around the area, so during day time, it was dusty and hot air blew.
At night, the cold winter wind passed through the waterproof canvases and gets very chilly.
In part two of her blog entry, she wrote about visiting old mills, or coal factories to find out about their needs.
She wrote more about that in her post:
Kids Playing at the Refugee Camp (Photo by Nang Nyi)
Some of the camps that they lived in are very near to the places where the fightings were going on.
We also got to a place where they said over a field of corn and a field of sugarcanes, they'll be back to their old village.
At such camps, they go back to their old villages to get drinking water.
They had to watch out for the situation, and avoid the gunfights.
On the morning that we were leaving, a man who went to harvest sugarcanes in a sugarcane field died of a bomb explosion.
Also, many people have died in those camps because of diarrhea.
On the second day of her trip, they and the responsible people from the camp held a small meeting to discuss about what the refugees needed, and what they can give back in return:
This Woman Sells Brooms and Sell them at Chinese Markets (Photo by Nang Nyi)
The main things that they need are drinking water, water for cooking, and toilets.
After that, medicines, and then foodstuff.
Clothes, kitchen items, blankets and pillows are sufficient due to donations from the Chinese villages.
But what they gave us were sweaters and pants, so they still need longyis for the women.
So we immediately donated the left-over money so that they can dig a well there.
In part three of her entry, Nang Nyi wrote about the terrible ordeals that the Kachin villagers faced:
One evening, the (Burmese) army came to the place where the villagers were hiding, and started shooting at them.
The villagers grabbed their children who were playing near the village and stream, and tried to run away, but a woman who had just given birth, her new seven-days-old child, a 4-year-old kid, and her mother were left at the village.
The villagers who were hiding in th forests heard the children crying all night, but they dared not go back into the village.
So they didn't run very far away, and waited all night.
Only after the soldiers left in early morning, the father of the 7-day-old-child, and the grandfather of the 4-year-old kid went back to look.
The two kids couldn't make a sound anymore due to crying all night.
The corpse of the mother of 7-day-old child, who had an bayonet wound from left rib to right rib, was found under a rock.
The villagers were not able to take her with them, nor bury her, so they just carried the kids, and left.
The mother of the 4-year-old kid was abducted by the soldiers, and haven't heard since.
She also wrote about what a Kachin villager had told them during the meeting:
A note written by a Kachin refugee, which says: "We all love you.
When you go back to Yangon, will you give us your phone number?
When you get back to Yangon, will you send us our photos?
We all love you"
"I am so happy that the Bamar kids are visiting us.
We do love the Bamar people.
After all, we are all human, so we 're happy and thankful that you came and helped us in anyway you can.
This is not because of how much you donated us, but because of your kind hearts.
We are happy that you will be helping us with the things we need, but what we really need are not those.
We want peace.
We want to go home.
We want to live peaceful in our own farm, in our own land, and in our own home with our families.
So please help us for that." - the villager told us with tears in his eyes.
When Nang Nyi and her friends left the camp, the villagers came along with them to their car.
She wrote about their farewell message:
A Group Photo of the Villagers at the Refugee Camp (Photo by Nang Nyi)
We told them, "We will see you again, but not here.
In Kachin State."
They cried when they heard that. They replied, "Yes, we also want to see you again, but not here.
We will meet you in our own villages".
The fulfillment of the wishes of the Kachin refugees may not be too far away.
Delegates of the KIO Army and representatives of the Burmese government will be meeting in Ruili for the third round of talks for ceasefire negotiation this week.
Before departing for Ruili, Sumlut Gam, Head of the Kachin delegates, said:
I'm optimistic.
Everything will be better."
Syria: A Year On, From Beirut With Love · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Syria Protests 2011/12.
On 15 March, 2012, the Syrian revolution marked its first anniversary with increasing determination that marked its beginning.
On this day many activists around the world rallied at the Global March Against the Syrian Dictator while protests were arranged in many cities around the world supporting the Syrian cause.
Lebanon, Syria's neighbour, and its capital Beirut, were not away from all what was happening despite the difficulties in freedom of expression lately.
There, activists faced this challenge and decided to do something different.
Beirut Walls explains the activists stance in Lebanon in the blog post entitled "The Syrian revolution after a year, from Beirut with love":
More than 8,000 people have been murdered, and thousands of people have been detained, homes destroyed and women raped.
A year has passed and we are on fire in Beirut watching what's happening in confusion not knowing what to do.
How can we be in solidarity with people being murdered and whose only crime is their determination to take down a regime that has been repressing them for decades?
How can we express our support and Beirut is full of thugs from different Baath, Ultra-National and Militant backgrounds?
Beirut Walls: To the Syrian revolution with love, used under CC.
Despite this, netizens and activist Twitter users announced their support for the Syrian revolution. @abirsasso , from Beirut, tweeted: A year passed and Syrian revolutionaries prove their creativity in their chants.
It is written on Beirut walls. #1YearAgo
While @taniaelk said:
Early this morning, on the 1st anniversary of the revolution in #Syria Beiruti activists sent a message of solidarity.
@NadineBek also assured the Lebanese solidarity with the Syrian revolution saying: Messages from Beirut to Syria's free people.
Activists in Beirut found another way to announce their solidarity with the Syrian people, by drawing graffiti and putting posters on walkways and bridges.
They also wrote and distributed slogans in the memory of the Syrian revolution.
Beirut Walls also wrote about the revolution morning including a video entitled: "From Beirut with love": Because the people's and individuals' solidarity is stronger and more important than official statements and the stance of politicians and sect and parties heads, we wanted to express our support to the Syrian revolution.
In the early hours of 15 March, and away from the different Lebanese official eyes, we were to spread these "messages" from Beirut to Syria's free people.

This post is part of our special coverage Syria Protests 2011/12.
Zeinab from Egypt joins the campaign
To mark the first anniversary of the violence which accompanied the Syrian revolution, which started on March 15, 2011, a campaign is being launched to mobilise a global action for celebrities, leading Twitter users and NGOs (CIHRS, FIDH, etc.) from around the world to mount a massive call on world leaders to unite and stop the bloodshed there.
People are being encouraged to take photographs holding a sign saying "UNITE FOR SYRIA" or "STOP ONE YEAR OF BLOODSHED" in their own language and upload them on the campaign's Facebook Page.
The campaign runs from Brazil to Indonesia to the Arab world and aims to generate as many reactions as possible.
On March 15, a global celebrity video will be launched, alongside the hash tag #UniteForSyria on Twitter.
In support of the global call, 50 world leaders have published an open letter in the Financial Times calling on UN Security Council members to "Unite for Syria and Stop One Year of bloodshed".
Turkey: Riot Police Continue to Clash with Kurds Celebrating Newroz · Global Voices
Kurdish people are the largest ethnic group in Turkey, making up 20 per cent of the population, which is close to 20 million people.
They have been subject to state-sanctioned discrimination and human rights violations.
Today, in Yuksekova, which is a district in the Hakkari province of Turkey, Kurdish people were attacked for gathering to celebrate Newroz - the Kurdish new year.
One Kurdish politician, Ahmed Turk was hospitalised, and 32-year-old Alaattin Okan was hit with a tear-gas canister in Batman.
Two prominent Kurdish websites were taken down earlier this morning, and have been unable to send updates regarding the clashes.
In addition to this, mainstream news sites have been slow in covering this story, which is why Kurdish activists have used social networking sites to raise awareness.
Faruk Arhan, a journalist for Bianet tweeted a picture showing a Kurdish woman being attacked by Turkish riot police:
Yüksekova
Yekbun Alp tweeted that a Kurdish MP was arrested, amidst clashes between Turkish riot police and Kurds who wanted to celebrate Newroz:
@YekbunAlp: MP Özdal Ücer was a guest of a family in Cizre when police attacked the house and arrested the family.
Another Kurdish activist, tweeted this picture, showing Turkish riot police firing tear-gas and Kurdish youth responding with stones out of anger and frustration that they can't even celebrate the Kurdish new year without being attacked:

Hawri Tofik from Sweden was among the hundreds of Kurdish activists angered by the Turkish government's brutality towards Kurds celebrating Newroz.
She tweeted:
@iirwaH: Seriously, I don't understand..
Why is it a crime to celebrate Newroz?
How many more Kurds gonna get injured/killed?
Jiyan Azadi tweeted this picture, saying tens of thousands gathered in Yuksekova, and later were attacked by riot police:

Meanwhile, Meltem Ay from London tweeted:
@jin_jiyan_azadi: How foolish of Turkey!
Dictatorship and oppressive methods will only unify the Kurdish people and make them stronger!
Alliance For Kurdish Rights has uploaded several pictures, showing Turkish riot police have used tear-gas and water canons to disperse protesters from the district of Yuksekova.

Uganda: The Anti-Gay Bill That Won't Go Away
The same bill that was presented in 2009 is showing up again for voting in Uganda:
Uganda has again re-tabled the controversial anti-gay bill.
Ugandan member of parliament, David Bahati, who proposed the bill back in 2009 has again considered tabling the draconian bill but with changes.
He claims to have dropped the death penalty and jailing of family members who fail to report homosexuals to the authorities.
However, under further scrutiny it has been noted that no changes have been made in the bill, and it is still exactly the same one presented back in 2009.
The following video explains the impact this bill will have on the LGBT community as well as their families and friends:

Spain: Crackdown Against Students Continues in Valencia
In Valencia, school children decided to protest budget cuts that affected their schools, forcing them to carry blankets with them due to lack of heating, in what has been a particularly cold winter in Europe.
Police reacted to the protests violently with students injured and detained; many videos have been made showing the abuses against minors, females and the elderly.
Just a few days after the brutal police crackdown at the Luis Vives Institute of Secondary Education in Valencia , students have again been the target of beatings, pushing and violence from the police at a pacific protest in which they were, precisely, demonstrating against police violence.
This time,the crackdown started on the afternoon with unexpected force.

Brazil: Quilombo Community in Bahia About to Be Evicted
One of the oldest slave descendent communities in Brazil, Quilombo Rio dos Macacos, where around 50 families live, has a date for eviction: March 4, 2012.
The claim for the land comes from the Navy of Brazil, that intends to broaden a condo for its officers in that territory, in the border area between Salvador and Simões Filho, state of Bahia...
Descendants of original peoples from Africa who, during colonialism, were taken from their land to become slaves in Brazil, the Quilombolas now see themselves under threat of losing their homes again, despite their right to the land they inhabit enshrined in the constitution.
This short documentary shows the situation the Quilombolas are facing: afraid to leave their houses, unable to move freely and fearing for their well-being, their families and their homes.

Bulgaria: Construction of the Nuclear Power Plant "Belene" Cancelled · Global Voices
On March 28, Bulgaria officially announced the cancellation of its newest nuclear power plant (NPP) “Belene” construction.
The Parliament has stopped this controversial project after years of discussion and more than half a billion euros invested in the construction of the first reactor.
The decision was announced not only by the mainstream media, but also by the Bulgarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Nikolay Mladenov, who tweeted:
@nmladenov: #Bulgaria suspends controversial #Belene Nuclear Power project that has cost hundreds of millions for the last 31 years...
A Facebook page screenshot of 'the European campaign to prevent the construction of a nuclear power plant in an earthquake-area in Belene, Bulgaria.'
A long-lasting fight surrounds this joint venture with Russia , which was to be built in an active seismic zone.
Activists have been continuously advocating to raise awareness about the risks of building a nuclear power plant in this region, recalling the Vrancea earthquake of 1977 , which caused the deaths of more than 1,600 people.
In Svishtov, a major Bulgarian city in the area, located 14 km away from the construction site, 120 people were killed back then; the 1977 earthquake also destroyed buildings in the city of Belene, just 3 km from the NPP site.
A report on the seismic risks, produced by Greenpeace activists and the Green Policy Institute in Bulgaria and published on the anti-NPP National coalition “BeleNE” website, showed that the previous report was inconsistent and no real risk assessment had been completed.
Thus, they concluded that no argument exists to claim that the zone is safe from a seismic standpoint and went on calling for the cancellation of the project.
But other considerations went into play in the Belene controversy.
Edvin Sugarev, a former MP, started a huge discussion on his blog svobodata.com (translates as “the freedom”):
@andrewmacdowall: #Belene #nuclear plant scrapped.
Is this the end of a four-decade saga?
NPP could have been a boost for #Bulgaria http://t.co/ITf1IOhn
Many Bulgarians believe this NPP would have helped the country to alleviate the ever-increasing prices of electricity.
Also, the question to arise is: how will the money spent on the now-aborted project be taken back?

Spain: Historic Battle of Almansa Remembered in Valencia · Global Voices
On April 25, 2012 it was hard to miss the soccer world's surprising news: FC Barcelona had been eliminated from the Champions League.
Online and in the streets, everyone was talking about it — that is, except certain Valencian netizens, who used the internet to take part in an annual remembrance of April 25, 1707: the day that Valencia lost its political autonomy to the Kingdom of Spain.
Every year, this commemoration has been purely civic; the day has never been institutionally recognized as one of historic importance.
This year, the Valencian parliament (Les Corts Valencianes), controlled by the right-wing People's Party, preferred to pay homage to the Valencians who participated in the Cádiz Cortes during the French occupation of Spain during the Napoleonic Wars and the drafting of the Spanish Constitution of 1812.
Popular portrait of Philip V of Spain hung upside down in remembrance of his orders to burn the Valencian town of Xàtiva
Those who wished to celebrate April 25 in a different way took to the streets that Saturday, as part of a contemporary tradition, a series of protests and concerts organized by Acció Cultural del País Valencià (Cultural Action for Valencia or ACPV).
Others took to the internet and honored the day through social networking.
Every spring, Valencians remember the fateful moment in their history, when Archduke Charles of Austria suffered military defeat at the hands of Philip d'Anjou's army at the Battle of Almansa, against the backdrop of the Spanish War of Succession: a continental battle for control of Spain, in which Franco-Spanish soldiers fought against the allied armies of England, Portugal, The Netherlands and Germany.
Given the international ramifications of the conflict, it's understandable that traditional narratives tend to overlook the serious consequences the War of Succession had for Spain's Catalan-speaking regions-Valencia, the Balearic Islands and Catalonia-where the event is remembered as the main reason for the loss of political independence (for a comparison of historical perspectives, see the differences between Battle of Almansa articles on Vikipèdia and Wikipedia).
Certain blogs, like Hic Sunt Leones , explain the history:

Spain: Images of Police Brutality During General Strike · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Europe in Crisis.
On #29M (29 March) Spain's trade unions called a general strike in protest against the Labour Reform introduced by Mariano Rajoy's (of the Popular Party) government.
This strike was the first that the government has faced, and only 100 days after Rajoy came to power.
The massive demonstrations held all over the country came as a result of measures adopted by the Executive, which in its eagerness to take the quickest route out of the economic crisis and to create jobs has deregulated the labour market, made it easier to fire workers, increased employer's flexibility to increase working hours, decreased wages, encouraged the mobility of workers, and facilitated the hiring of young people on work experience placements for longer periods.
Groups of citizen movements not linked to the main trade unions, such as ¡Democracia Real Ya! joined the strike in the so-called 'Critical block' .
Throughout the day of the strike, in which a majority of workers participated, there were numerous moments of tension, especially in Barcelona where riot police clashed with protesters.
Once again, the security agents failed to wear their identification badges.
Protesters wounded by rubber bullets during the general strike, Barcelona.

During the day, which passed peacefully in the majority of cities, there were confrontations between various groups.
In the following video we present the case of the firefighters, who were protesting the cuts that they are suffering, and who were also the target of violence by the riot police who charged and beat them:
In the next two videos filmed by activists, we can see that the police were carrying electric batons.
In the first video, protesters surround them while we see two police officers (the slowest) running away.
The second video, filmed from the opposite perspective, shows the four at the head of the crowd (a blonde woman and three men), an attack on a protester who falls to the ground, and the two from the first video slightly behind the others.
The protesters discover once again a group of police officers infiltrated in the crowd to attack protesters and heighten tensions so that the subsequent police charge would be in some way justified. (Source: http://www.tercerainformacion.es/spip.php?article35508 ):
Another video shows the statement made from hospital by a protester who was hit by a rubber bullet fired by police during the strike in Barcelona.
He has two broken ribs and a punctured lung.
Spain: King Juan Carlos and the Elephant in Botswana · Global Voices
Days after Felipe Juan Froilan accidentally shot himself in the foot during shooting practice, his grandfather, King Juan Carlos I of Spain, fell while he was hunting and broke his pelvis.
This would have been minor news, had it not been for the fact that he was hunting elephants in Botswana on the kind of safari that can cost up to $60,000 USD .
That the King of Spain would pay thousands to kill animals (while his country is suffering from recession, no less) has been deeply troubling for many, and this was clear on the blogosphere.
Carlos Canicero sarcastically mused: "What's going on with the Bourbons and shotguns?
Can't they live without shooting?"
Lola Pardo of El País pointed out that Rann Safaris, the agency through which Juan Carlos booked his hunt, had shut down its website , shortly after a photo disseminated through the internet, showing the King posing before an elephant carcass.
Spain: General Strike Across Cities and Neighborhoods · Global Voices
This is how Kaos en la Red summarize the motives:
With this slogan, the Assembly of the Neighborhood Los Austrias in Madrid convened the 29M General Strike (on March 29) in Spain, which had a massive attendance across the country.
This direct call to action is contrasted with the labor unions' more impersonal slogans - "They want to change everything" - and is an example of the rift that opens in every social movement between the official conveners and those who demonstrate without a flag of any sort.
In this sense, the 15M movement has been a turning point in terms of supporting the calls of a part of civil society, organized in collectives, neighborhood assemblies, and local or individually-led associations.
In this general strike, the citizen movement has taken different forms in the streets, neighborhoods, social organizations, and digital social networks.
One of the initiatives has been the "consumption strike."
Many took to the streets with their own food and drinks from home:
